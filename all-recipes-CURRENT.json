Get your own awesome on with these nori seaweed snacks!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"nori_seaweed_green_sushi_sheets_pic\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31556\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2015/08/nori_seaweed_green_sushi_sheets_pic-300x200.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:300px\" /> Seaweed has been used for generations in both the culinary and spa industry. It has exceptional health benefits for both internal and external use. Seaweed has become one of the most popular ingredients in natural skin and hair care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pampering ourselves with seaweed has many benefits: It can help to hydrate, firm, and rejuvenate the skin as well as add moisture, shine, and softness to hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, there is more to seaweed than meets the eye. In the culinary world, seaweed is recognized as a highly nutritious food that promotes health and longevity. It is low in fat and has little or no caloric energy. Like eating fresh fruits and vegetables results in maximum nutritional value, so does eating fresh seaweed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Seaweed is rich in vitamins A, B, C, E, and K. They are an important supply of 60 trace elements and an excellent source of over twelve minerals, especially potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, and manganese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Seaweed can be used in many ways: it can be added to soups, topped on salads, used as wraps and rolls. Here is a seaweed snack variation that you might not have tried before. This Nori seaweed cracker recipe is loaded with calcium, potassium, niacin, iodine, magnesium, and vitamins A and C. This healthy snack is very simple to make and can satisfy your urge for something savory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"Mary Luciano - Nori Seaweed Snack - Photo 3_pic\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34868\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/02/Mary-Luciano-Nori-Seaweed-Snack-Photo-3_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n",

		"articleBodyHTML" : "<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Warm up from the inside out with this amazing West African peanut soup: the place where nutrition and great flavor walk hand in hand!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"peanut soup 2_pic\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34897\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/02/peanut-soup-2_pic-300x200.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:300px\" />As the colder months take a little longer to wind down, stews and soups help keep us warm. There&rsquo;s nothing better than coming in from a bone-chilling day outside and enjoying a hot soup to warm the soul. Here in Toronto, it gets really cold, so I thought I would make a West African peanut soup. This soup is completely different than anything you will ever have. Peanut soup is native to Africa and even eastern Asia. And it isn&#39;t your traditional watery soup. This soup is hearty filled with peanuts, spices, and sweet potatoes. This soup is bursting with nutrients and vitamins such as vitamin A and C!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This soup has such an incredible earthy taste from the peanut butter. Make sure to buy natural peanut butter without sugar. I used a full fat coconut milk in my recipe but you can always opt to use the low fat version. I added finely sliced Swiss chard to my recipe but if you are having problems finding chard, you can always use kale or collard greens. Make sure to remove the stem before placing it in the soup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If you have an allergy to peanuts, you can always substitute the peanut butter for roasted almond butter. I&rsquo;ve tried it, and it&rsquo;s absolutely delicious. This soup can be served over rice, millet, or couscous. If you feel adventurous, you can add some sliced chili peppers, okra, and diced plantains! This will add to the soup&rsquo;s incredible flavor profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This recipe will yield a large amount, so any leftovers can be placed in the freezer in an air tight container. I love doubling up on recipes so that I have leftovers during the week. With every reheat, the tastes just becomes more vibrant and complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There are plenty of variations to this soup, but I hope you enjoy my vegan and gluten free version!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"peanut soup 1_pic\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34896\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/02/peanut-soup-1_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:550px; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Fennel has been proven to be useful in strengthening hair and preventing hair loss as well as protecting the eyes from premature aging and macular degeneration. Eating fennel can also reduce the effects of PMS related pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Carrot</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and potassium present in carrots help lower blood pressure, boost the immune system, and are great for our skin and eyes. Eating carrots can assist in regulating blood sugar, cholesterol, and digestion. To top it off munching on these crunchy orange veggies has been linked to a reduced risk of stoke, heart diseases, and several cancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Citrus</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The high levels of potassium in citrus fruits not only boost heart health but also help prevent cramping in the muscles while exercising. Consumption of citrus helps regulate high blood pressure, prevent kidney disease, boost heart health, fight against viral infections, and is good for the skin and the eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/healthhub/?s=fennel\" target=\"_blank\">Loving fennel?

		"articleBodyHTML" : "<h2>Have a burger, without the bun, without the meat, but with all the flavor and health! We bring you the bun-less Portobello hemp burger!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"portobella_pic\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34983\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/03/portobella_pic-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" />Do you ever crave a hearty and filling burger? I call the portobello; the steak of the vegetarian world! Portobello mushrooms are hearty and have a meaty texture. Portobellos can be grilled and cooked without falling apart which is great for this recipe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time and time again, I see recipes which just swap out a hamburger patty for a portobello mushroom. Boring! It&rsquo;s time we revamped the portobello burger and switched things around. The portobello needs to be praised a little higher than it has been. Always hiding behind cheese, meat or cream based sauces. It&rsquo;s time we put the portobello on a pedestal and admire its incredible capabilities!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of using a bun, I used two portobello mushrooms. This gave the sandwich so much more flavor and depth. More than any plain bun could ever do! Since the portobello is marinated in mustard and balsamic, it adds an umami flavor to the entire dish. Mushrooms absorb a lot of liquid so marinating them ahead of time will only add more flavor to the dish. Since portobellos are quiet meaty, they are quiet filling. This sandwich will sustain you for hours. I decided to fill this sandwich with a hemp slaw. It&rsquo;s my favorite go to salads in the winter! Hemp seeds are on the most incredible sources of plant based protein. One tablespoon of hemp seeds contains around 5 grams of protein. They contain omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids which are crucial to our body&rsquo;s function. Hemp seeds have a wonderful nutty taste that pairs well with anything from savory dishes to sweet desserts. In this recipe I used around 3/4 cup of slaw in the sandwich. You can eat the rest of the slaw as a side to this dish or keep it in an air tight container for 3&ndash;4 days in the fridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"portobella 3_pic\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-34982\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/03/portobella-3_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:500px; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n",

Pineapples also contain vitamin C, an antioxidant required for growth and repair of muscle tissue that promotes healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Including two key hydrating vegetables such as celery and cucumber can add an extra punch. Celery, a hydrating vegetable made up mostly of water, helps replenish the sodium and potassium your body loses during exercise. Both nutrients are necessary to maintain proper mineral balance in our bodies. Low sodium and potassium can cause muscle cramping which can hinder performance and cause discomfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Cucumbers full of silica are ideal for supporting healthy joints and connective tissue.

This yummy Mango Lassi will prove it.<img alt=\"mango_lassi_drink_smooth_yummy_pic\" class=\"alignright wp-image-30141\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2015/05/mango_lassi_drink_smooth_yummy_pic-180x300.jpg\" style=\"height:293px; width:180px\" /></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Mango Lassi is a famous Indian drink created primarily to cool your body and provide healthy probiotics. This drink is originally made up of mangoes, white sugar, butter milk, and refined salt. Even though it tastes delicious and is fermented, it still isn&rsquo;t a healthy drink due to the loads of white sugar and milk. As a vegan, one of my main reasons to avoid milk is due to the fact that it is loaded with antibiotics, hormones, and even mucus. Drinking milk creates more acid in our bodies, disturbing our body&rsquo;s alkaline level, and by consuming antibiotics we are eventually harming our bodies. This combined with processed white sugar leads to skin breakouts, colon problems, yeast infections, and bad insulin levels. The solution? To create a raw vegan healthy version that tastes delicious and is packed with nutrition and healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Mangoes are irresistible juicy fruits packed with vitamin C, vitamin A, nutritious malic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid, which build a strong immune system and keep your body alkaline. Mangoes combined with protein-rich almonds high in vitamin E, packed with anti-inflammatory properties, vitamin K, and iron makes this Mango Lassi a high carb and protein drink. This strong base topped with flavorful cardamom and honey provides a drink made in heaven that is delicious, filling, and nutritious. You can also choose a probiotic of your choice from a health store and add it to your drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"mango_lassi_drink_healthy_version_yummy_pic\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30140\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2015/05/mango_lassi_drink_healthy_version_yummy_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:350px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n",

The bursting flavors of mango and pineapple mask the bitterness of the kale and spinach. Dates provide tons of dietary fiber and essential vitamins and minerals. It&rsquo;s been said that you could survive off just three dates per day! They are great to use as an alternative sweetener instead of refined sugar. The hemp seeds add a perfect combination of omega 3s and 6s. Hemp seed could very well be one of the most nutritious seeds in the world. It&rsquo;s got a nutty flavor and a crunch that adds some texture to the smoothie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Green Goodness is a great way to start the morning or a perfect way to end a workout. No matter what your diet, it&rsquo;s important to make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough protein to support you throughout the day. Protein is the building block for muscle, bone, blood, cartilage, and skin. You need it to repair tissues in your body you&rsquo;ve put strain on by being active or even by participating in your day to day activities. Not all protein is made equal, so make sure you check where your protein is being sourced from and if it&rsquo;s high quality and easily absorbed by your body. Bad proteins often contain fillers you don&rsquo;t need or artificial flavors or sweeteners. Don&rsquo;t forget to get your greens on!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article-photos/healthHub-mainarticle-760x375-green-goodness-smoothie.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></h3>\r\n",

I usually throw them in the blender with my soups, smoothies, or salad dressings. They have a bitter, black pepper taste, so don&#39;t put all of them in the blender (I have learned that the hard way). Usually, 1&ndash;2 teaspoons is great with no overpowering taste. You can save the rest and freeze them for later use, or dehydrate them in a dehydrator till crispy, and then blend into powder with coffee grinder. (I have a grinder that I use just for nuts, seeds, herbs, and cinnamon sticks). Store papaya powder in a container or shaker, and sprinkle on your foods to enhance digestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"spinach papaya gazpacho_pic\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33438\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2015/11/spinach-papaya-gazpacho_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:500px; width:500px\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Dust with lime zest and serve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most recipes that use whole foods, this drink&rsquo;s great taste is equaled by its nutritional benefits. Just&nbsp;<em>look</em>&nbsp;at what you&rsquo;re getting in your glass!</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Beet<em><img alt=\"Sunwarrior beet juice-slant\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/02/Sunwarrior-beet-juice-slant-300x225.jpeg\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px\" /></em></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re the type of person who is concerned about exposure to toxins, and you want to give your body as much support as possible, get some beets into your diet! A wonderful tonic for the liver, beets also work as a purifier for the blood. Both the beetroot and its greens are high in many vitamins and minerals, too. But if that&rsquo;s not enough&mdash;beets are high in boron, which is directly related to the production of human sex hormones: in fact, the ancient Romans used beets as an aphrodisiac.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Carrot</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>As a kid, you&rsquo;re told to eat your carrots, but not too many or you may turn orange! Whether or not you end up with a tinted complexion, at the root of it all you&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;have improved vision, healthier skin, and lower risk of a variety of forms of cancer. Change it up, and give different colors of carrots a try: purple, orange, white&mdash;they each have a slightly different flavor profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Tangerine</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>These tasty citrus fruits are loaded with vitamin C, which protects cells by neutralizing free radicals. Free radicals cause chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, so we definitely want to defuse those suckers. Tangerines can also help lower cholesterol, relieve constipation, and protect the skin. Although they are acidic to the taste, tangerines and other citrus fruits actually help alkalize the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Grape<img alt=\"grapes_purple_fruit_pic\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2012/08/grapes_purple_fruit_pic-300x200.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px\" /></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat too many grapes and you may end up in the bathroom longer than expected&hellip; they can be&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>helpful in treating constipation and indigestion! These juicy fruits are also said to cure asthma by increasing moisture in the lungs. You&rsquo;ll also hear that they reduce the risk of breast cancer and even help stave off Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Sweet Potato</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeling stressed? Sweet potatoes contain magnesium, the go-to mineral for calming down. As if that weren&rsquo;t sweet enough, the tasty tubers are loaded with vitamin A, which can help protect against sun damage and promote healthy, glowing skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Ginger</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>With a long history of use as a nausea remedy, ginger is also used to reduce exercise-induced muscle pain, lower blood sugar, and to help cure sinus infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Lime</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Citrus peels contain high levels of anti-oxidants, a good reason to keep lime zest in the limelight, so to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Once you have reached the correct consistency, let it sit for an hour or so.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Forming and cooking the Tortilla</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few ways to do this but for me the easiest way was putting a little flour(corn or even coconut four for a different flavor) on a bread board, taking about a 2 inch ball or bigger and pressing flat down on the dough and spreading it out with your hand. The dough shouldn&rsquo;t stick to the board. I then used a wok and set the stove top on high and when it was hot cooked on both sides until it become a golden char grilled color.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guacamole</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take out the seed of the avocado. Spoon the avocado into a bowl and mash. Remove the seeds in the center of the tomato. Chop it up finely and add to mix. Chop jalapeno. I like to leave the seeds for the extra bite, but it is optional. Chop up one quarter red onion very finely and add. Make sure to squeeze the lime juice into it and add salt to your liking. Set in fridge. FYI- you can take the inner seed and leave it in the mix to prevent oxidation and the Guacamole turning color.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Refried Style Beans</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>drain beans if you&rsquo;re using a can. Place chopped and saut&eacute;ed onions in a medium saut&eacute; pan until lightly browned. Set aside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a grill, grill the red pepper and jalapeno until charred on the outside. Once done, chop it up and add all ingredients to a Vitamix or food processor and process until smooth. Put in a container and set aside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used a jar of Trader Joes beans and corn salsa and chopped up some romaine lettuce to add to the tortilla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once prepared, don&rsquo;t be afraid to add some hot sauce for extra zing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy</p>\r\n",

It has been proven to help fight cancer, heart disease, and aging due to its abundance of antioxidants. It also has been found to increase blood flow to the arteries, lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots, and boost cognitive performance. Cocoa also contains the substance phenethylamine, which acts as a mood elevator and natural antidepressant.

You&rsquo;re welcome.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t love waking up to the smell of pancakes in the morning? The sweet smell of nutmeg and cinnamon will flourish through your kitchen. Easter brunch or suppers are a mix of sweet and savory. Easter morning is a special time when family and friends get together, so why not celebrate with protein berry pancakes. They are gluten free, vegan, and full of nutrients. Your guests will be begging for seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/03/easter%20pancakes%202_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe can hold so many incredible flavors. A great alternative would be to add 1 zest of a lemon with 1/3 cup lemon juice. Add 1 tablespoon poppy seeds and omit the nutmeg. Now you have delicious lemon poppy seed protein pancakes. The lemon will burst in your mouth with flavor as the poppy seeds crunch. You could even drizzle some delicious coconut butter on top. That is what you call a masterpiece!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Easter would not be complete without having carrot cake, so why not create carrot cake pancakes? They are delicious and only call for the addition of carrots and coconut. Make the same recipe as listed below, simply add 1/2 cup shredded carrots and 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut. This is the best way to have dessert as breakfast. The best part is that these pancakes are light and nutritious without adding any refined sugars to the mixture. Add a dollop of coconut whip cream to finish the dish or if you want a touch of sweetness, you can add a drizzle of maple syrup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown rice flour is an awesome alternative to white rice flour. It has more fiber which keeps you fuller longer and contains vitamins and nutrients our body needs. In this recipe we will use a &ldquo;flax egg&rdquo; which is the replacement for one egg. One flax egg consists of 1 tablespoon of flax meal combined with 3 tablespoons of water. Let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken and voila, we have the perfect vegan binding agent for any recipe. The best part about this recipe is that it only takes around 10 minutes from start to finish! Happy Easter!</p>\r\n",

You can have your cupcake and eat it too!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years ago, I came across a book by Christopher Mcdougall called <em>Born to Run</em> about an Ultra-marathoner. He mentions a fascinating Tribe known as the Tarahumaras. I decided to do a little research into this Tribe. The Tarahumara are a Native American people of Northwestern Mexico. They are known for their incredible level of endurance. They run long distances of up to 200 miles over a period of a couple of days. They would run for hunting, transportation, and communicating to others. When it came to hunting, they would literally run the animal down until it would be physically exhausted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/03/cupcakes_MAIN_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found more of an interest in what they ate, thinking that a huge part of their endurance must come down to nutrition. Their food consists mainly of corn, beans, lentils, chia, squash, sweet potatoes, and some fruit. Only 5% or less of their food consists of flesh from animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I researched a particular mix known as Pinole. Pinole dates back as far as the Aztecs and they have a diet that consists mainly of roasted ground corn, chia, cinnamon, spices, and some sweetener.

And although it is nice to give in to those cravings from time to time, it&rsquo;s best to start your day on a healthy note.

You have a fine oiled machine that can process junk that may be consumed later in the day. So I make sure I start my day right and get in a good portion of fresh fruits, veggies, vitamins and minerals first thing in the morning. That way, if my day ends with a few yummy finger foods, I don&rsquo;t feel as awful as I would have otherwise!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how do I make sure to get all those vitamin and enzyme rich foods in? It&rsquo;s easy! I just make my Green Goddess Smoothie! It looks like a lot of ingredients, but you can add or take out whatever your craving-fits desire.

Usually end up using spinach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Celery: this has boat loads of fiber to fill you up and keep you energized!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fruit: adding half a cup of frozen blueberries or half a green apple will sweeten your smoothie and provide extra vitamins! I keep my freezer full of frozen berries. They are cheaper to buy and last forever, so they&rsquo;re always on hand to toss into my smoothies!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flax Oil: I can&rsquo;t stress to you how important healthy oils are for you and your baby! They improve your cardiovascular system which is just what a brand new system needs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelp Powder: Your growing baby needs iodine and this is an excellent source! I find it&rsquo;s difficult to consume a lot of sea vegetables, but they are so, so good for you! This is a simple way to be sure you are getting some in your diet every morning!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nutritional Yeast: Every expecting mom who has ever found herself exhausted mid-day for no reason, raise your hand... Yep. Just as I imagined. Heck, we are growing body parts, people! Of course we are tired!! Well then, you&rsquo;ll soon find that nutritional yeast is one of the easiest ways to put a pep back in your step. Loaded with B-vitamins, nutritional yeast gives you the sustained energy that you need while growing your precious little one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/03/green%203_article_pic.png\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:200px\" />Chia Seeds: these little guys pack a lot of punch (especially for those vegans who need more plant based proteins)!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plant Based Protein Powder: I love<a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-vanilla-1kg\"> Sunwarrior Warrior Blend with the vanilla flavoring</a>! Stay as far away from whey and soy protein as you can! Plant based protein is now your new best friend. Easier to digest for you and baby!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cinnamon: This spice has far too many health benefits to list here. If you&rsquo;re bored, google it. See for yourself. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at it&rsquo;s powers! Add about a teaspoon (more or less for taste)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Distilled Water: Use more or less of this depending on how thick you like your smoothie. Do not&hellip; I repeat&hellip; DO NOT use tap water for any reason (unless it first went through a filter of some sort). Don&rsquo;t get me started on all the crap the water treatment plants put into our systems! You can use spring water or even apple juice or coconut water, if you want more flavor to your smoothie!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are ambitious, feel free to add more to the smoothie! I sometimes put in barley grass powder, psyllium seed husks (talk about FIBER!), vitamin C crystals, a green powder, raw cacao powder, liquid chlorophyll and aloe juice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheers!</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>XO, Shandi Finnessey</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

To do this fill a large pan or bowl with warm water, dip in one rice paper wrap at a time, submerging for a few moments, (until soft and pliable yet not too long. They will still be a little stiff yet soften as you fill them). Place on a clean tea towel in a single layer. Working quickly, repeat until all wrappers have been soaked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To roll: Place two mint leaves on lower half of wrapper, then the tempeh, arrange with a small stack of the various veggies. Fold wrapper over filling, turn in ends and roll up as tightly as you can. Place on a Nappa or lettuce lined platter and repeat until all wrappers have been filled.

		"articleBodyHTML" : "<h2>Celebrate cool weather with this refreshing and satisfying spinach apple salad!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/spinach%20salad%201.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:240px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:320px\" />This &ldquo;winter salad&rdquo; is actually great anytime, but the combined notes of orange, cranberry and pecan just really sing to me in the colder months. Since we continue to have a bit of brisk weather with winter still clinging to mornings and evenings, now is the perfect time. Every ingredient in the dish serves both a culinary and a nutritional purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spinach provides the leafy base for this recipe, because in addition to tasting great, the iron-rich green is known for its ability to restore energy, increase vitality, and improve the overall quality of the blood. I tossed in two kinds of fiber-rich apples&mdash;this time combining Granny Smith with Gala&mdash;to capture the contrast of tart and sweet along with the addition of some crunch. Beyond tasting delicious, apples help with weight management and contribute to overall health, detoxify the liver, boost the immune system, and may even lower the risk of diseases such as Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that avocados contain more potassium than bananas? They offer a sort of creaminess to the salad, and they&rsquo;ll help keep you from getting hungry too soon after lunch. Avocados are also rich in fat, but it&rsquo;s not the kind we need to shy away from. The fat in avocados is oleic acid, which has been linked to reduced inflammation and may even lower your risk of cancer. Oranges are not only a great source of vitamin C, but provide our bodies with many other benefits as well such as lowering cholesterol, boosting heart health, promoting good vision and protecting the skin. <img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/spinach%20salad%203.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:240px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:320px\" />Their acidic flavor complements the fatty elements in the salad, too. Cranberries have anti-inflammatory properties, and they work to protect the cardiovascular system and liver. The dried cranberries I used in this recipe adds a chewy contrast to the other&mdash;crunchy and creamy&mdash;elements of the salad. And finally, the inclusion of pecans in this dish means even more health benefits, including those to skin, hair, bones, and teeth. Whether you say &ldquo;pih-CAHN&rdquo; OR &ldquo;pih-CAN,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll agree that these mild, sweet nuts are a pronounced addition to the salad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end result&mdash;a sophisticated symphony of seasonal supplies&mdash;requires nothing more than a simple drizzle of oil and balsamic vinegar to finish it off.</p>\r\n",

You call them what you want; I&rsquo;ll call them what I want.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love brownies. I mean I absolutely FIEND for them. They are my favorite sweet treat, so when I turned vegan last year, I became saddened, thinking I would never be able to indulge in these little bites of heaven again. Oh man, was I ever wrong! Never assume you cannot enjoy your most favorite foods just because you aren&rsquo;t consuming animal products. Most of the time, you can find a way to make your favorite recipes with little to no work added in besides making a stop to your local health food store or even a big chain grocery store! So don&rsquo;t fret, I have a recipe for you that you can make over and over again, for holidays, special occasions, or just for a nice wine and dine night in with your friends or loved ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/blondie%20brownie_MAIN_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is my story of how I came up with my brownies:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day before Easter, I was leaning on my kitchen counter feeling sullen, wondering what I could offer to my family that both me and them could enjoy! I was absolutely stressed over the thought of having to bake something non-vegan, and then an idea popped into my head: Go to the grocery store and check out the vegan substitutes they had for eggs and butter, then make the most delicious brownies anyone had ever tasted! That is just what I did. I made a concoction I like to call Vegan Orangey Brownies. They aren&rsquo;t your chocolate, fudgey brownies. These are moist and white like a yellow cake, with a sweet glaze on top. They are definitely more blonde than brown, but they taste amazing no matter what you call them. These brownies require very little time and skill in the kitchen and will have you, your family, and your friends swooning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Packed with nutrients and protein, this mediterranean&nbsp;falafel bowl makes dinner a delight!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Summer&rsquo;s coming, and so are new, healthy eating patterns for those beach bodies. Sound about right? Kick start your season with an awesome protein-packed Mediterranean falafel bowl. Falafels and hummus are the most common and popular foods eaten in the Mediterranean and Middle East. There&rsquo;s definitely a reason for it: they are delicious! For this recipe, I used whatever I had in the fridge such as avocados, cucumbers, tomatoes and red onions. I then sprinkled hemp seeds and tahini over the bowl. You can make your own tahini or you can simply buy a jar from your local organic store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/falafel%202_MAIN_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key step to this recipe is to remember to soak your dried chickpeas the night before. Just place them in a bowl with water and voila, by morning they will be ready. This recipe calls for parsley and cilantro. If you despise cilantro, not to worry, just double up on the parsley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to making the perfect falafel is to obtain the right texture, which means not over mixing it. You want the mixture to be the size of large bread crumbs not mush! If that happens, your falafel balls will not be in the shape of balls anymore! Once you have shaped your falafel balls, let them sit for half an hour to really absorb the flavors and then pop them into the oven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are considering going plant based or incorporating more vegan or vegetarian foods into your diet, the falafel is a great place to start. Falafels are the meatless patties of the heavens. Chickpeas have a huge amount of fiber which help you stay fuller longer. They also do not have soy which makes them a great choice for those who have intolerances to soy. At the end of the day, you are eating a vegetable that is packed with nutrients and protein! These falafel balls are only around 40 calories each!</p>\r\n",

This&nbsp;Coconut Chia Seed Pudding provides all the energy and nutrition you need and can be made beforehand, so all you have to do is open your fridge and dig in your spoon!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok people! I know we are always on the lookout for another healthy and easy recipe we can share with our families. Well look no further! I have your mornings covered with a nutrient-packed breakfast that everyone will love!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/chia%20seeds_MAIN_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A super simple and incredibly yummy dish that I like to make is Coconut Chia Seed Pudding. I know&hellip; Sounds like &ldquo;Whaaa??&rdquo; but once you try it and see how easy it is to make and how tasty and filling it can be, it will surely become your &ldquo;go to&rdquo; for a healthy breakfast!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This little meal is especially great for vegans to ensure you get an adequate amount of protein in your diet. Also, I love to eat it now that I am a little over half way into my pregnancy with our first child (it&rsquo;s a BOY!!) since I know the ingredients are great for momma and growing baby!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of us know chia seeds from the commercials back in the day, urging you to purchase a little clay animal that you would smear chia seeds on top of, add water and then&hellip; Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia! Your Chia Pet would grow green &ldquo;hair.&rdquo; Never did I think that one day I would be EATING those little seeds! But as grandma always said&hellip; Never say never! And boy was she right! After becoming vegan in 2009, I became obsessed with learning about superfoods, and these little guys are considered one of the healthiest foods on the planet! They are loaded with nutrients that have important benefits for your body and brain. Rich in protein, fiber, omega-3 fats (the GOOD fats that we all want and need!), vitamins and minerals, chia seeds deliver a massive amount of nutrients with very little calories (is this real life?). They are thought to provide sustainable energy, and check this out&hellip; even the word &ldquo;chia&rdquo; is the ancient Mayan word for &ldquo;strength.&rdquo; How cool is that? Now, don&rsquo;t you want to go gobble some up?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But wait&hellip; There&rsquo;s more! Ladies who are doing their best to hold back the hands of time (I&rsquo;m there with ya, sister), these little guys are jam-packed with antioxidants! What does that mean for you? It means they work to fight free radicals in your body, which attack molecules in our cells and unfortunately is what contributes to ageing and yucky diseases like cancer (the only time you&rsquo;ll see me say that ugly C-word).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay. So here&rsquo;s the basic recipe (there&rsquo;s more later on how you can mix this up to your liking):</p>\r\n",

Once you are sure all the seeds have had a good dunking in the liquid (they like to float on top or stick to the sides of the bowl), go ahead and cover the bowl and stick it in your fridge. It&rsquo;s best to let them &ldquo;chill&rdquo; for about 2 hours but I find it&rsquo;s even better to make the night before and plan on having it for breakfast in the morning! When you go to eat the pudding, be sure to give it a good stir again, as the seeds have plumped up and may be stuck together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe makes about one healthy sized serving. I tend to double or triple the recipe so I have a bowl of goodness waiting in the fridge for me when I get the munchies. This will keep a few days too, if you plan on making extras. Having something readily available always helps to prevent me reaching for that bag of chips or chocolate bar in a crunch (trust me, I do still reach for those too! But it&rsquo;s always wise to have something healthy in your system first to help break down whatever processed junk MAY enter your body later in the day). Also, this is one of my favorite bowls of yummies to have since chia seeds are so high in protein and fiber, both of which have been shown to aid weight loss! (Can I get an Amen?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe is incredibly versatile too! You can add a scoop of raw cacao, a spoonful of raw honey and/or cinnamon to mix up the flavors a bit or throw on a handful of ripe berries if that is what tickles your taste buds. The point is, have fun with your chia seeds!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy Eating!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XO, Shandi Finnessey</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/healthhub/21-of-the-best-uses-for-chia-seeds\" target=\"_blank\">Learn some of the best uses for chia!</a></p>\r\n",

And as a bonus, here&rsquo;s the buzz on honey!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most healthy-living experts will tell you to keep your sugar consumption in check. They suggest that when you do whip up a dessert-style dish, to use unrefined, whole food products, such as dates or other dried fruits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/cran%20oat%203.jpg\" style=\"height:450px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another sweetener worth a look for our vegetarian friends is honey. Easier to store and use than dried fruits, honey can simply be stirred or mixed into drinks and recipes. It requires no refrigeration, has an indefinite shelf life, and it comes in as many varieties as there are combinations of climates and plants. The flavor of a particular honey will vary based on the types of flower from which the nectar was harvested by the bees. Although it&rsquo;s high in fructose, when used in moderation, honey has many health benefits. It contains vitamins and minerals, as well as nutraceuticals, which are effective for the removal of free radicals from the body. Easy to digest, honey is a good source of energy, especially for athletes. (Please note that health experts recommend waiting until after 12 months of age to give infants honey.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all honey is created equal. In fact, a large percentage of the supermarket honey available has been extremely processed. When purchasing, select <em>raw</em>, unfiltered, and 100% pure, and buy from a source you trust, such as a local apiary. Honey is graded by color; light golden honey often comes at a higher retail price than darker varieties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While pasteurized honey is widely available&mdash;pasteurized honey has been heated and processed to remove impurities&mdash;raw honey is preferable to many health enthusiasts. Because it is removed from the hive and bottled directly, raw honey contains trace amounts wax and pollen. Consuming local raw honey is believed to help with seasonal allergies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we have the buzz on honey, let&rsquo;s test it out in this raw and simple-to-make recipe.</p>\r\n",

You can also roast your butternut squash before boiling it. This adds a smoky flavor that is scrumptious. You can also roast the squash seeds in the oven and add them as a garnish to the soup. All you need to do is remove the seeds, drizzle with a tad of olive oil and bake them at 375 degrees for 10 minutes! This can be done while the soup is cooking!</p>\r\n",

White rice is highly refined and processed, which often strips many nutritional qualities away including the side hull and bran, both of which are rich in proteins, fiber, magnesium, thiamine, zinc, and calcium.

Selenium and manganese are two of these benefits. Selenium aides in reducing the risk of some cancers, arthritis, and heart problems while manganese helps our body to produce good fats and helps out our reproductive and nervous systems. 80% of our daily manganese requirement can be found in just one cup of brown rice! High in fiber and rich in anti-oxidants, this whole grain rice is also easier to digest, which keeps your bowels functioning smoothly. Diabetics would find this a great choice as it helps to stabilize blood-sugar levels.

While I&rsquo;m all for balance and choosing which nutritional battle to take on, I also knew this particular store bought item had to be an easy thing to reproduce on a much healthier scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To remedy this, I came up with my own recipe for a semi-homemade nondairy coffee creamer. The only thing that changes is the flavors I add! Are you a coffee drinker? Give one or both of these recipes a try and let me know what you think by commenting below. Cheers!</p>\r\n",

So good, you&rsquo;ll want seconds!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As spring weather moves in, we tend to crave something lighter and sweeter! This amazing cashew cheesecake is super simple to make and requires no baking. All you need is a small springform pan, some parchment paper, and a freezer. Many people are apprehensive or question if cashews can stand up to its cheesy, non-vegan counterpart. The answer is, yes! Cashews create a lovely creamy and rich texture just like cheese. This recipe has been tried and tested by my whole circle of friends and even for traditional cheesecake lovers, it was a success!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/cheesecake%20full_MAIN_Rachel_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are only a handful ingredients in this cake. That&rsquo;s the beauty of this recipe, simplicity. The crust itself only contains three ingredients, dates, almonds and walnuts. Using dates in any recipe can add a boost of fiber and natural sweetness. Make sure to use raw cashews and not toasted as this will change the taste of the cheesecake drastically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soaking your cashews is imperative to this recipe. You want your cheesecake to be luscious and smooth, not clumpy! Make sure to use boiling hot water to soak your cashews and in no time, your nuts will be ready to hit the food processor. The beautiful thing about this recipe is its versatility. I added a strawberry swirl to this recipe but you can play around with different variations such as blueberry lemon, something more exotic like mango, coconut, and goji berry or even chocolate and peanut butter. This recipe is wonderful for anyone who is gluten free, dairy free, and vegan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy this super luscious and sexy cheesecake, it will definitely make you come back for seconds!</p>\r\n",

The new and improved sweet and delightful treat has taken oven. Nana-ice cream, the ultimate no-guilt comfort food that will leave you satisfied and wanting seconds. This simple recipe is made with only a handful of ingredients. The base of this recipe is frozen bananas. When you blend them with a little water or nut milk, it creates a beautiful ice-cream-like texture. The best part is that it&rsquo;s 100 percent natural, raw, vegan, and gluten free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/peach%20nana%202_MAIN_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many people who suffer from lactose intolerance, inability to consume sugar, or who are vegan. Since this recipe only uses frozen fruits, it&rsquo;s the perfect recipe for anyone. This is a great idea to serve the kids to replace high fat and high sugar ice creams. A typical ice cream serving (which is usually &frac12;&ndash;&frac34; cup) comes in a whopping 200 plus calories and more than 20&ndash;25 grams of sugar. A nana-cream has only 60 calories per serving and less than 10 grams of natural sugars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since spring is here, I used peaches in my recipe. You can go bananas (no pun intended) and add whichever flavors you desire. Here are some variations:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chocolate peanut butter: 1.5 cup frozen banana, 1/3 cup almond milk, 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder, and 1 tablespoon natural peanut butter</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strawberries and cr&egrave;me: 2 cups frozen strawberries with &frac12; cup coconut milk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mint chocolate: 2 cup frozen bananas, &frac12; cup almond milk, 1 tablespoon raw cocoa, 1 tablespoon fresh mint leaves, 1 teaspoon spirulina. Blend frozen bananas with almond milk and remove from blender. Add 1 tablespoon raw cacao to one bowl and 1 tablespoon of mint and spirulina to the other. Mix separately and then combine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy this spring and this rocking recipe for banana ice cream!</p>\r\n",

Dinner with this asparagus and Celeriac soup will be your favorite part of the day!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>April marks the beginning of spring, a beautiful transitional time between cold to warm. The days are longer and packed with sunshine. The trees are blooming, and the plants are thriving. This time of year is absolutely stunning. With spring comes in season vegetables and fruits that are too delicious to ignore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/Rachel_MAIN_asparagus_soup_2_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shopping for produce in season has so many perks, the first being that it is 100 percent more nutritious. After the produce is picked, enzymes start depleting rapidly. Out of season produce will travel long distances to reach its final destination. While in transit, many key nutrients are lost. Another great perk to shopping in season is to support local farmers. The price of local produce is typically less than fruits and vegetables that have been imported from around the world. Lastly, local produce always tastes fresher and crispier!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the spring, lighter fare items replace dense hearty meals from colder months. There is one item that stays on any menu all year around. That item is soup. Just because it&rsquo;s getting warmer doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to put that soup spoon down. Spring soups are always vibrant and bursting with fresh flavors. They are light and refreshing, being served hot or cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beautiful soup is made with spring fresh vegetables such as asparagus, peas, celeriac and mint. Celeriac is a root vegetable not many people know or use in their cooking. It&rsquo;s a great alternative to using potatoes in soups or stews as it has a lower starch content. It&rsquo;s also great source of fiber, potassium and calcium. Asparagus is not only delicious. but it&rsquo;s also another vegetable packed with health benefits such as fiber, minerals, and folate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This soup only takes 30 minutes from start to finish and can be stored in the freezer for later use.</p>\r\n",

They are no bake and gluten free but full of flavor!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing up in an Italian home you could almost always find a jar of Nutella in the house. It was not uncommon to slather Nutella on a nice piece of crostini bread and bring it to school for lunch. Most Italian kids my age loved their Nutella sandwiches. I was not one of them. Sadly, a jar of peanut butter was not on the top of an Italian family&rsquo;s grocery list in the 70&rsquo;s. I still remember with deep fondness when I was introduced to my first peanut butter sandwich. One day, I decided to swap my Nutella sandwich with someone else&rsquo;s peanut butter sandwich (there was no such thing as a nut free school in those days). I had never heard of peanut butter. &ldquo;Peanut butter, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; I remember saying to my non-Italian friend. &ldquo;Want some?&rdquo; she said. From that time on, if I had a Nutella sandwich for lunch, I would call upon my favorite friend who almost always brought peanut butter sandwiches to school and swap lunches. That&rsquo;s when my love affair with peanut butter started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/pb%20bars_MAIN_Mary%20Luciano_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These bars are dedicated to that special friend who introduced me to peanut butter. These bars are super quick, easy to make, gluten-free, and vegan. This delicious treat not only satisfies your sweet tooth, but your peanut butter craving as well. If you haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, I am just cuckoo for peanut butter!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s best to keep these bars in the fridge or freezer so that they last longer. They taste better if kept cold. Personally, I enjoy eating them frozen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to use raw cacao nibs instead of chocolate chips. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I enjoy chocolate from time to time, but it does not have to be a staple food in my diet. I find that the cacao nibs add a nice crunch to the bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sweetened these bars using raw honey however, feel free to experiment with other sweeteners of your choice. If you are truly a peanut butter lover, you can skip the sweeteners altogether since these bars taste delicious without the sweet stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just be forewarned, you can easily polish off the whole batch at once.</p>\r\n",

You can simply substitute cup for cup in this recipe. If you find that the crust is too dry, try adding in more water or a 1 tablespoon of arrowroot flour.</p>\r\n",

This low in calories and sugar recipe is <span style=\"font-size:22px\">not </span>low on flavor!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The sun is shining, the birds are chirping and cold desserts are arriving. A classic Asian dessert drink uses tapioca pearls. Tapioca is derived from the root of a cassava plant and is naturally gluten free. Tapioca is naturally a thickening agent so it&rsquo;s a great alternative many desserts such as pies, puddings and jellies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/04/bubble%20tea%201_MAIN_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bubble teas either have a variety of black or white pearls or bobas. The texture and constancy is chewy but has a sweet undertone to them. Typically, bubble teas are high in calories and sugar but don&rsquo;t fret, this recipe will change your life. It&rsquo;s low in calories and sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to obtaining the perfect bubble tea is cooking the tapioca pearls to perfection. Make sure there&rsquo;s enough water to cover the tapioca and as soon as they float to the top, put the lid on and let them work their magic. If you have left over tapioca, you can place them in an airtight container as soon as they are cooled. They will last one day covered in the fridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To give the bubble tea its signature creaminess, I used coconut milk. You can use any nondairy unsweetened milk of choice. Hemp, rice, soy, almond or coconut milk will all taste delicious. To sweeten the tea you can use either a simple syrup, a splash of agave or maple syrup or a tsp of coconut sugar. In terms of tea, you can use whatever tea you like. I used a blood orange tea which gave the drink a fruity flavor. Another great option is using matcha powder with your nondairy milk. The earthiness of the matcha pairs beautifully with the silkiness of the nondairy milk. The variations are endless and the spring has only begun so let the tapioca season begin!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do organic&rdquo; tapioca pearls but you can find these at any local Asian supermarket.</p>\r\n",

		"articleBodyHTML" : "<h2>As spring rolls around and the winter becomes a chilly memory, it&rsquo;s a great time to start an overall spring detox of your body, mind, and kitchen!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is so much talk about cleansing and detoxing now a days and there&rsquo;s a reason for it: it creates healthy habits.&nbsp;There are so many ways to detox your body. Start with what you drink. Try to replace all sugary-based drinks with water. Try to replace coffee with green tea. Green tea has natural antioxidants and can detoxify the body. Coffee turns the body acidic which creates a hostile environment that allows bacteria and illness to thrive in the body. Adding green smoothies is another way to add nutrients that may be missing. It can also help remove toxins from your body. You can also detox the body by replacing one meal a day with a green smoothie. One of the best go-to smoothies is made with kale, bananas, parsley, coconut oil, and spinach. This amazing breakfast can fuel you until lunch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/pea%20shoot%20stir%20fry%201_FEATURED.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:670px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning to organic foods is another method of detoxing the body. Organic fruits and vegetables are not grown the same way conventional farmers grow their crops. Organic farmers will use natural fertilizers to feed their plants. Organic produce is GMO-free, which has been a rising concern in health over the years. Also, if purchasing meats; organically raised animals are not given antibiotics or hormones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years grocery stores have gotten larger, but with size came an overwhelming amount of processed and refined foods. You walk in to purchase tomatoes and walk out with a shopping cart full of food that you were enticed to buy. My theory that I stand by: always stick to the perimeter of the grocery store. This is where the most nutrient dense foods will be. As you stray within the isles, this is where temptation lays. Rows upon rows of processed foods. Everything in the grocery store has been strategically placed in order for you to purchase more, from the lighting and music to the food demonstrations. In recent years, companies have noticed that people are adhering to the &ldquo;perimeter rule&rdquo;. Be aware while selecting foods, and always read labels. Overall, when you&rsquo;re choosing the right foods, it creates a healthy habit to make good choices at the grocery store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/pea%20shoot%20stir%20fry%202_RECIPE.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:200px\" />Cutting out white sugar and flour will be beneficial for detoxing your body. Not only does sugar and flour add pounds to your waistline, it leaves you feeling lethargic and unhealthy. This deadly duo can make the body feel as though it is full but realistically your blood sugar level is increasing and then decreasing at such a high rate that your appetite returns with a vengeance. Try adding more complex carbohydrates such as brown rice and sweet potato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleeping is another way to reboot the system. Try to get to bed one hour earlier, even if you don&rsquo;t sleep right away, it creates a habit for your body. This will reset your internal clock and you will wake up feeling refreshed. Try to exercise a few times a week as well. This will release natural endorphins in the body. Not only will this help with overall weight and health goals, it will decrease your stress levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, eat more greens! Greens vegetables are natural powerhouses that are packed with essential vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. They are low in fat and carbohydrates and provide an excellent source of plant based protein. This recipe for steamed pea shoots is a delicious way to get key nutrients in the body.</p>\r\n",

No, really, ice pops, the healthy refreshing cool treat of summer.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s finally summertime, and while some might scream for ice cream, others prefer a healthier, faster-to-make chilly treat. Enter homemade ice pops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re just starting to dabble in the ice pop arena, here are a few tips and a fun beginner recipe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/Freezer%20Pop-Glass%20block%20brite3_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start simple. The most basic pops don&rsquo;t require a recipe or a mold. Just make a combo of your favorite fruit juice. Pour your liquid into 3-ounce paper cups. Cover the cups with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Insert a wooden craft stick through the wrap or foil to hold the stick in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t rule out vegetable juice pops. Pick veggies that are a little on the sweet side like beets and carrots. Consider using fresh herbs in your blend: cucumber, lime, and mint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texturize your pops by adding chunks of fresh fruit, thinly sliced dried fruit, nuts and even cooked grains. These ingredients will sometimes sink to the bottom of the pops; to prevent this, fill your mold partially with liquid and freeze partially. Add your ingredients in a layer or stir them in and add the rest of the liquid before returning pops to the freezer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freezing time varies depending on your base (creamier bases take longer), what kind of mold you are using, and the efficiency of your freezer. Generally expect to wait a couple of hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember liquid expands as it freezes. Do not overfill your molds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fruit loses some of its sweetness after freezing, so if you have a big sweet tooth, consider adding a little sweetener before you freeze. Liquid sweeteners tend to work well. Some granulated sweeteners can result in a grainy texture if they are not fully dissolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ice pops will keep for about four weeks if you wrap them tightly. Beyond a month, however, they start to lose some of their flavor.</p>\r\n",

Now, this isn&rsquo;t your ordinary dairy ice cream. This creamy ice cream is made with coconut cr&egrave;me and vanilla. This is a great alternative to those who are lactose intolerant or vegan. This recipe is dairy free, egg free, raw, and vegan. This ice cream reminds me of my favorite soft serve as a child minus all of the added sugars and dairy. An added bonus to making your own homemade ice cream is that it is half the price of store bought ice cream. Here in Toronto, a tub can run anywhere from 6$ to 12$! Yikes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/ice%20cream%201_MAIN_pic.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have an ice cream maker, you can simply place all of the ingredients in and let the machine do the work. If you don&rsquo;t have an ice cream machine, this recipe takes a little patience and time but I promise it&rsquo;s worth it. Once the ingredients are blended together, place in freezer. You need to stir and whip the ice cream every 30&ndash;40 minutes to allow air in. This will have an end result of a creamy and delicious soft texture. If you want a harder based ice cream, you can stir it once or twice and leave it to set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full fat coconut cr&egrave;me will allow you to get that wonderful creamy mouth feel. If you use lower fat coconut milk, there will be more ice crystals therefore resulting in a harder ice cream. I love using the seeds from a vanilla bean as it adds a natural and delicate flavor to the ice cream. The best part is adding your favorite toppings to this ice cream. I love using my homemade cookie dough and carob chips. You can add fresh fruit, nuts and any ingredients you desire. After all, it is your masterpiece!</p>\r\n",

These flavors are beautiful when they are combined, creating a marriage of balance that is to be savored. Every country has its own take on flavors; these represent their culture, environment, and food profiles. Thailand is known for robust and fresh flavors with an attention to detail in each dish. Thai cuisine is growing in popularity over the world: Pad Thai and curries to the simplicity of a mango salad. This recipe will give you the base of a beautiful red Thai curry that can be used in soups, stews, and curries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/red%20curry%20paste_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe is a spin on the usual Thai curry pastes. This recipe calls for roasted red peppers and tomato paste. You can roast the peppers yourself, or you can buy a jar of organic roasted peppers, which makes life a little easier. If you want to roast your own peppers, just preheat the oven to 400 degrees, line a baking tray with parchment paper, and bake your peppers for 20 minutes, flipping them over half way through baking. The beautiful thing about this recipe is that it&rsquo;s a lower sodium option then most store bought pastes. You can always opt out of using low sodium tamari by replacing it with Himalayan salt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two ingredients that really make this dish flourish. The lime leaves and lemongrass. These two ingredients can be found at your local Asian supermarket. If you&rsquo;ve never worked with lemon grass before, it&rsquo;s always best to remove the outside layer. After you&rsquo;ve remove it, chop it into 1 inch pieces and throw the pieces in to your food processor. Lime leaves are also crucial for this dish. It gives the curry paste a fragrant and aromatic taste that reflects Thailand&rsquo;s unique and vibrant taste.</p>\r\n",

White vinegar is a natural deodorizer, absorbing odors instead of covering them up. With no coloring agents, white vinegar won&#39;t stain grout on tiled surfaces. In the kitchen, use vinegar-and-water spray to clean countertops, lightly soiled range surfaces and backsplash areas. In the bathroom, spray countertops, floors and exterior surfaces of the toilet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The less water you dilute the vinegar with, the stronger it works. Undiluted white vinegar works quicker on tougher cleaning problems involving hard water deposits or soap scum. Undiluted vinegar works particularly well on the inside of the toilet bowl.

Breakfast never looked so good!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Start with a simple combo of oats and nuts, add a little oil and a sweetener and then dress it up&mdash;or down&mdash;for just about any season!&nbsp; Here are a few pointers to make sure your granola is always the talk of the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/Sheree_0333.jpeg\" style=\"height:399px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Feel your oats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For best results, select old-fashioned rolled oats over the quick-cooking or steel-cut kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go big or go home</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because there are lots of ingredients&mdash;most of them in small pieces or flakes&mdash;a big mixing bowl is a must for combining your granola mixture. The right bowl will give you plenty of room to combine ingredients easily and quickly without making a giant mess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make a template</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best things about granola is how easy it is to make substitutions. Find a good recipe and make it the first time according to the recipe directions. Then put your own stamp on it by switching things up. Try dried cherries or cranberries instead of raisins. Ditch the nuts and stir in pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds. (Work to keep the ratio of wet-to-dry ingredients roughly the same as in the original recipe for best results.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spice it up</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cinnamon is a natural in granola, but you can have fun with small amounts of allspice or cardamom, or try a spice blend like pumpkin pie or apple pie spice. Flavored extracts open up another world of flavor options, but start out sparingly, a little can go a long way, depending on the extract. And don&rsquo;t forget the salt&mdash;it adds dimension to the finished granola and keeps it from being too sweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chew the fat</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course you want to make granola as healthy as possible, but if you don&rsquo;t use any oil, you&#39;re going to have a pile of dry oats. Olive and coconut oil are the most commonly used in granola recipes, but you can experiment with small batches using oils to complement your other ingredients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cool it</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure your granola has completely cooled before storing. Condensation from still-warm granola in a closed container will make the mixture sticky and limp.</p>\r\n",

If you make them with health in mind, you will be thrilled with the results!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These little snacks are a staple in my kitchen. They are simple to make and packed with nutrients and protein. The best part about these treats is that they are made with brown rice cereal instead of its heavily processed counterpart. Unlike the store bought brand, this recipe uses brown rice syrup to hold the bars together. You can always use honey if you do not have brown rice syrup in your pantry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/03/rice%20crispy%20bars_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:670px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown rice, unlike white, still has the hull and bran on it. This hull provides the rice grain with vitamins and fiber. Brown rice is also low on the glycemic rating which reduces insulin spikes. This is great for anyone trying to watch their figure or wanting to add more nutrients into their daily diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe calls for almond butter because of its nutritional elements. Almond butter contains heart healthy fats and fiber. Almond butter is a higher fat food but it contains monounsaturated fats which helps reduce cholesterol levels and aids in weight loss. Switching from unhealthy fats such as trans fats found in fast food and junk food to monounsaturated fats such as almond butter, olive oil and avocados are a great way to reduce the mid line. Almond butter is also very high in protein, coming in at a whopping 7&ndash;8 grams of protein per 2 tablespoons. You can either make your own almond butter at home or purchase it at the store. Just be wary of any added sugars, salt and additives. Always read the labels and be aware of what you are buying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do not like almond butter, don&rsquo;t fret. You can sub this for any nut butter such as cashew, walnut, or even hazelnut.</p>\r\n",

Combining two of my favorites: tacos and breakfast - genius!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure you have read or heard about how important breakfast is to your health. But, some people just can&rsquo;t stomach the thought of eating anything in the morning. Is that you? If so, you are definitely not alone, as a surprising amount of people skip breakfast for one reason or another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/taco_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breakfast helps prevent that mid-morning blood sugar crash that leaves you feeling fatigued and irritable later in the day. By getting something in our systems before we run out the door, we can stabilize our blood sugar levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes a successful breakfast?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting a blend of protein, carbohydrates, and fat is a great start! These macronutrients will ensure you have energy to nail your morning meetings. Major bright flavor from the cilantro-lime dressing wakes up the senses, which can be helpful in the morning :) These tacos are also easy to make, grab and go. No utensils required!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope this entree-inspired breakfast recipe encourages you, or someone you know, to start your day with the right nutrients to fuel your morning.</p>\r\n",

Green smoothies are a perfect way to amass all of the nutrients that may be missing from your day to day repertoire. You can add any fruits or vegetables that you like and blend it up! This smoothie bowl uses coconut water, matcha powder, greens, and pumpkin seeds, which all have their own special properties and health benefits. Smoothie bowls are naturally sweet and filling. At this time of year, we tend to be more active either taking part in activities outside, walking, or swimming. This smoothie bowl will keep you hydrated, replenished, and will add a large amount of plant-based protein, which will help your muscles recover from any type of workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/03/green%20smoothie_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matcha or green tea powder is one of the richest foods in antioxidants. Antioxidants can kill free radial cells in the body which have been linked to cancer. They are our first line of defense in the body or, as I like to call them, my internal soldiers. Matcha can boost our energy levels and endurance while boosting our memory. We added a scoop of <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/classic-plus-natural-1k\">Sunwarrior protein</a> to give our smoothie bowl a burst of protein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This smoothie bowl has coconut water to keep you refreshed the entire day. Coconut water has a large amount of natural electrolytes and mineral rich fluids which replenishes you after a long workout or prior to a workout. Coconut water also aids in indigestion and stomach aches. We added avocado to incorporate healthy fats and potassium. Avocados contain more potassium than a banana! Potassium can help reduce cramps in the body after a workout. Potassium helps regulate fluid glance and activity of the heart in the body. Lastly we added a protein powerhouse: pumpkin seeds. These little guys are high in fiber, high in protein and minerals, and help reduce inflammation in the body.</p>\r\n",

One of the healthiest, most delicious and fun herbs to cook with is basil.

Basil is easy to grow both indoors and outdoors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/03/basil%20pesto%20_MAIN\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basil, high in vitamin A and C, is excellent for vision, bone health, skin and immune boosting.

It is not a coincidence that the walnut resembles the shape of the brain. In addition to improving memory and brain function, the omega 3 fatty acids found in walnuts contain inflammation-fighting powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pecans, are loaded with minerals such as magnesium, zinc, iron, calcium, and selenium. They are high in vitamin E, which is beneficial for heart health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, this recipe includes cilantro which is an amazing toxic-metal cleaner. If you suffer from mercury exposure, add some cilantro leaves to your smoothie or juices to flush any heavy metals out of your body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cilantro is also known as coriander in the culinary world. Coriander is the seed of the cilantro plant. this herb is very popular and widely used in a number of cultural dishes from the Middle East, Latin America, India, and the Mediterranean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This pesto recipe is far from the traditional Italian recipe that includes parmesan cheese, pine nuts and olive oil; however, it is equally tasty and delicious.

Our thoughts affect our health just as much as food and lifestyle habits do. Love your body and love your self. Everything you do, and think, impacts the direction of your life. It is not about being perfect. It&rsquo;s about knowing that life is full of twists and turns, and it&rsquo;s our duty to learn from every thing that comes our way. The ups, the downs, the middle. All of it. Stop fighting yourself, stop fighting the flow of life, accept where you are, and accept the challenges. Focus on the present moment and what you can do in the here and now. <em>Abundant health and happiness is in the present moment.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do right now to be happy and healthy? What choices can you make? What food choices can you make? What lifestyle choices can you make? What thoughts can you choose to attach yourself to? (It&rsquo;s human nature to have negative thoughts. The learning adventure of life is to learn to let negative thoughts go when they happen. This is where yoga and meditation helps). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stop judging yourself. You always have a choice.

It is known that honey has also been found to keep levels of blood sugar fairly constant compared to other types of sugar.</p>\r\n",

Quick, convenient and portable, a good vegan energy bar can serve as a meal replacement, pre or post workout treat, or a handy protein source. Eating snack-size protein bars can help reduce overeating between meals. Unfortunately, many store-bought bars are high in sugar or sodium, and some contain preservatives, animal products, or filler ingredients. For cheaper, healthier energy options, you&rsquo;re really better off making your own!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/Sunwarrior%20Apricot%20Ball_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the recipe below for Apricot Energy Rounds is simple to make&mdash;and delightful to eat&mdash;we hope you&rsquo;ll be inspired to make up your own no-bake energy bar recipe for bars, bites, or balls. Here are a few more thought-starters to get you on your way:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Give some extra &ldquo;oomph&rdquo; to your energy bars by incorporating a top quality protein powder, such as <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-mocha-1kg\">Sunwarrior</a> into your recipes. Adjust your moisture by adding a few drops of water or additional dried fruits to the batter, so the mixture binds properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add an extra punch of flavor with natural extracts. Think outside of the usual vanilla, and test-drive chocolate, coconut, rum, almond, butterscotch, or one of the dozens of other flavors available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spices can also ramp up the flavor of your energy snacks. Cinnamon is the one most often used, but you can also draw on ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, or a spice blend such as pumpkin pie spice or apple pie spice. Start with a half teaspoon, as some dried spices can be rather strong.</p>\r\n",

A chocolate cherry smoothie recipe!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Illuminate. What does that mean? According to Merriam-Webster, there are a few different choices. My favorite definition is this: &ldquo;to enlighten spiritually or intellectually.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I sit here and enjoy this Chocolate Cherry Smoothie made with Sunwarrior&rsquo;s intensely delicious <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/illumin8-aztec-chocolate-1k\">Illumin8 plant-based organic meal replacement shake</a> in Aztec Chocolate flavor, I&rsquo;m enlightened about what weight loss really entails, and how my own challenging process has led me to what I believe is the most delicious, nutritious, and satisfying diet on the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/sunwarrior-illumin8-natalienorman_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following each of my complicated pregnancies, I struggled to lose weight. The more I failed, the worse I felt about myself. My sense of self-love tangled with the flawed concept of will-power, or the power to starve myself and lose weight. I always believed that some form of starvation and suffering was necessary if I was to be truly tough or committed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember one day in particular back when I was on a mainstream packaged-food diet and knew I had already eaten my designated chemical-bomb bars for the afternoon. I was driving to a furniture store to complete a purchase with my baby in tow. I was starving and miserable but knew I had to be strong and push through the day. This is just what I&rsquo;d accepted as the weight loss process. I was unhappy. I didn&rsquo;t love myself. And I was setting myself up for a cycle of failure with every passing week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, I lost a few pounds on those expensive, unrealistic diet programs. But that kind of weight loss never lasted. My body craved real food and high-quality nutrition. Ultimately, I failed. Thank goodness, really. It was those failures that led to my moment of illumination. When I hit rock bottom and couldn&rsquo;t see a way to lose the pregnancy weight once and for all, I finally discovered a raw vegan lifestyle, and the rest is history. (And so is the weight!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, eight years into my journey as a raw vegan, I can&rsquo;t believe I used to live that way, punishing myself all the time. Today, I am my strongest, happiest self, and I accomplish this with ample food intake that supports my energy levels and nourishes my body in full. My diet is rich in&nbsp;fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs, and healthy fats like avocado and hemp seed. I also enjoy high-quality raw vegan protein from Sunwarrior and was thrilled when they released the illumin8 line of shakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/illumin8-natalie_ARTICLE.jpg\" style=\"height:250px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>illumin8 makes for a filling, energizing meal on the go, as it contains, not only clean plant-based protein, but also gluten-free carbs, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and plenty of fiber, too. As a busy mom, I am always needed somewhere, so it has been wonderful to have illumin8 in my arsenal of healthy food choices that I can prepare in minutes. I can whip up a shake, put it into a glass mason jar with a screw-top lid, and zip out the door to take my son to practice, no problem! And no temptation or cravings for unhealthy foods because I am already well-nourished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a vegan culinary artist and raw food teacher, I was excited to experiment with illumin8 in the kitchen. Because it contains so many hearty and nutrient-dense plant ingredients on its own, I found that I could blend it with a banana and water and enjoy it in its simplest form that way. But I love to include fresh water-rich plants in my meals whenever possible, too. So I made quite a few different smoothies using raw fruits and greens. Some of these varieties included blending a scoop of illumin8 with 3 cups of greens like kale, chard, collards, or spinach along with bananas, berries, and water. (Note: If you use kale in a green smoothie, I recommend removing the stems first, as they can be bitter.) illumin8 blended well with every smoothie I created. Of course, my favorite is the recipe I&rsquo;m sharing below. That one knocked my socks off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/sunwarrior-illumin8-natalienorman_ARTICLE.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:200px\" />Now, let&rsquo;s dive into this truly yummy Chocolate Cherry Smoothie recipe that is both simple and fast to prepare while packing in ample plant-based nutrition to keep you fueled all day. Chocolate and cherries tend to conjure up an image of dessert, and rightfully so. Chefs worldwide pair these flavors to bring clientele a magical culinary experience, but often this is at the cost of the diner&rsquo;s health as they ingest sweets packed with animal fats, refined sugar, and processed flour. In contrast, I&rsquo;ve blended <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/illumin8-aztec-chocolate-1k\">Sunwarrior&rsquo;s Aztec chocolate Illumin8</a> with wholesome fruits to give it the same delectable flavor as a sweet dessert without any of the unhealthy ingredients. You win, your body wins, and your taste buds REALLY win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there&rsquo;s my moment of illumination, and hopefully yours, too: You can lose weight and attain your best health by eating delicious chocolate! Who knew? Leave behind the fad diets, the starvation, and all that self-sabotaging guilt FOREVER. Be illuminated. Be happy. Be healthy!</p>\r\n",

Tempeh is used as a meat substitute for vegans and stands up to any other substitute. Tempeh contains a huge source of protein and has a versatile. yet earthy, flavor. It can be used raw in salads or cooked in main courses. Most soy products are highly processed and refined and contain a huge amount of added chemicals that can lead to sickness and intolerances over the years. When purchasing tempeh, try to buy organic as this ensures that no additives have been used. Tempeh is a way better option over tofu as the soybeans have been fermented, which gives it a predigested state, making for easy absorption into the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/tempeh%20meatballs%202_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These meatballs take around 40 minutes to make from start to finish. I used gluten free breadcrumbs in this recipe, but if you do not have any intolerances you can opt for the regular breadcrumbs. You can bake the meatballs or fry them. If you are frying them, cook them in a tablespoon of coconut oil or avocado oil to ensure you are receiving all of the nutritional benefits of the oil. If you want to add a beautiful cheesy flavor to your dish, sprinkle a little nutritional yeast on top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use whichever noodles you like for this recipe. I love the taste of using zucchini, but you can add carrots, turnips, carrots, or beets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important part is that these meatballs are savoury, delicious, fresh and simple.

Check out the three uses you might not have heard about before!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As health-conscious, natural-living sun warriors, many of us probably use activated charcoal in our beauty routines in a number of awesomely effective ways: teeth whitener, detoxifier, face mask, but the natural powerhouse has many other, more obscure, uses as a beauty product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I am sharing three of my favorite, lesser known ways to incorporate activated charcoal into your beauty routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/bugbalm4_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How is Activated Charcoal Made?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you&rsquo;re not familiar, activated charcoal is a naturally occurring compound that is made by heating regular charcoal in the presence of gas to around 600&ndash;900C. The heating process creates tiny pores in the charcoal. These pores act as powerful binding agents that can adsorb many different compounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adsorbing is different than absorbing. Adsorbing means that the compound collects other compounds on its surface. Absorbing means the compound takes the compounds in; our bodies absorb nutrients while activated charcoal adsorbs toxins and poisons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Topical Remedies for Bites and Stings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because activated charcoal is such a powerful absorber, it&rsquo;s a wonderfully effective natural option for relief from insect bites and stings. Putting activated charcoal on top of a mosquito bite will help pull the poisons out of the area, relieving itching and redness.</p>\r\n",

Tempeh has grown in popularity in the vegan community due to its high protein content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top your salad with whichever dressing you like.

Try it for yourself!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Not everyone eats corn. Some eschew it due to food allergies and others are convinced it&rsquo;s nutritionally void and too difficult to digest. Currently, over 90% of U.S. corn is genetically engineered (GE), which is another strike against the starchy vegetable (which, technically is a grain, but that&rsquo;s another article for another time!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/Corn%20Salad%20skewed_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you, most of the year I don&rsquo;t eat much corn. I don&rsquo;t think of it being particularly healthful and, unless it&rsquo;s summertime, the corn available is either frozen, trucked in from far away or just too tough to taste good. But right now&mdash;because I live in Iowa, which you could call &ldquo;corn central&rdquo;&mdash;I am doing my share of shuckin&rsquo;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organic (non-GE) sweet corn is one of summer&rsquo;s simplest pleasures. A freshly-plucked ear is delicious eaten straight out of its husk; it needs no butter, no salt, no cooking&mdash;no kidding! You can also dress corn up, like in this salad mixed with other in-season vegetables including red bell peppers, tomatoes, and cilantro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to enjoying corn is to recognize it for the fleeting delight that it is. Old corn is not good corn, and my best advice is not to buy an ear that was picked more than 24 hours ago. Avoid corn with dry, pale husks and silks. Test corn by piercing a kernel with your fingernail: it should squirt a whitish juice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your eyes were bigger than your stomach and you find yourself with leftover ears, place extra corn in your refrigerator as soon as possible. Leave the husks on, and store it uncovered. Keep the temperature at or below 40 degrees so the natural sugars are less likely to turn to starch. Eat it in less than two days if you plan to have &ldquo;fresh corn,&rdquo; or use it in a recipe where less-than-fresh corn won&rsquo;t be as noticeable. You can also remove the kernels from the ears and freeze.</p>\r\n",

Mangoes not only provide a sweet flavor and a beautiful orange color, they also pack a health-dense punch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This creation of mine is clearly mango based. But, before I share the recipe with you, let me highlight the main ingredient: mangoes. Let&rsquo;s discuss all the benefits of this amazing fruit!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/mangoesandcreamsmoothiebowltitleimage_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alkalize the Body</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mangos are high in tartaric acid and malic acid which help the body to maintain a healthy pH. An acidic body leads to inflammation and disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Balance Blood Pressure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the high amounts of magnesium and potassium found in mangos, they provide a natural way to keep blood pressure levels in check. Magnesium is also great for healthy muscle contraction, utilizing B vitamins, and it helps the body to absorb calcium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Brain Health</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t want a healthy brain? We need our brain for everything we do in life: from breathing to writing a 5000 word essay.

The B vitamins also help support a healthy mood and healthy sleep patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bone Health</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mangoes are high in vitamin K which is an essential vitamin in building strong bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/mango.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:200px\" />High in Fiber</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means better digestion and elimination. Health begins in the gut, so ensuring a healthy gut is crucial for overall wellness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increasing Immunity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to their high amount of beta-carotene, mangoes help increase immunity, protecting us from sickness and infection. Beta-carotene also ensures healthy skin, hair, teeth and gums, plus promotes the growth of strong bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[<a href=\"https://draxe.com/mango-nutrition/\" target=\"_blank\">https://draxe.com/mango-nutrition/</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you see why we should be eating mangoes, not only because they taste good, but because they are a nutritional powerhouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you buy a can, of full fat coconut milk, you will open it and a hard cream substance (which is the fat) will be on top. That is the cream, and that is the part of the coconut milk we will be using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t like to waste so I pour the coconut water, which will be under the coconut cream, into a jar and use it in other recipes.</p>\r\n",

Fresh turmeric is so healthy and helpful for reducing inflammation. I am always thinking of new, creative ways to use turmeric than solely in curries or savory dishes. (It has an earthy taste, so it can overpower the flavor of recipes if not combined with other foods in a balanced way). I discovered that when you add turmeric to a healthy, raw chocolate smoothie or chocolate dessert, the dominant taste of the chocolate hides the earthy turmeric taste. Hooray! I love a great tasting smoothie that has the hidden healing powers of fresh food from the earth, such as this one that has turmeric, spinach, and zucchini in it. Don&rsquo;t be weirded out by this one until you try it! It sounds odd, but it&rsquo;s simply delicious.

It looks similar to ginger, except it is a little smaller in size, and the inside is a bright orange or yellow. It will be in the fresh veggie section, so ask your supermarket for help when trying to locate it. Fresh turmeric is known to have cancer fighting abilities. A must for anyone trying to heal cancer or going through chemotherapy. A must for anyone trying to keep their immune system robust and strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without further delay, may I present to you a delicious and creamy, anti-inflammatory, magnesium-rich, nutrient dense, energizing, and healing, raw, vegan smoothie to knock your chocolate socks off!</p>\r\n",

Remove the saucepan from the heat to let cool slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Pour the melted chocolate mixture and the remaining ingredients of the ganache into a blender (I used a Magic Bullet).

The ganache will harden as it cools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For the Marshmallow Meringue Topping:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Bring a small saucepan with 2 inches of water to a simmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Pour the egg whites, honey, vanilla, and salt into a heat-proof bowl. Place the bowl on top of the saucepan, making sure the bowl doesn&rsquo;t touch the water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Begin to whisk the contents of the bowl until it becomes slightly warm, approximately 3&ndash;5 minutes. Foam will start to develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and pour the ice water into the mixture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Immediately begin to whisk the mix, keeping it in the same bowl, on high until the mixture stiffens, much like the stiff peaks of whipped cream. You can use a handheld beater or stand-up mixer. The time it takes will vary. I did this with a handheld beater and it took at least 10 minutes for the mix to stiffen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. The meringue will gradually deflate and is best enjoyed upon serving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take the cooled crust and place a generous spoonful of the chocolate ganache in the center. Flatten the chocolate out with a spoon.

Deep breathing is the fastest way to alkalize the body and calm the mind. Smile, and tell yourself you love yourself. Keep practicing this every day until you believe it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gracious Living Smoothie Tip #1:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use frozen bananas for creamier smoothies. Wait till the bananas are ripe, peel the skin off, break the bananas into pieces, and store in a Ziplock bag or glass container in the freezer for your smoothie use. You can also freeze apples (core and cut into chunks), pineapples, papayas, kiwis, oranges, peaches, grapes, watermelon, mangos, pears, etc. Cut everything yourself and then freeze them in portion sizes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can freeze your kale, spinach, and other dark green leafy vegetables. You can even freeze your herbs. Cilantro, basil, mint, and rosemary are my Gracious Living faves in smoothies (although you don&rsquo;t need to freeze rosemary). Just peel them from the stem and store in a Ziplock bag. Use as needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can freeze your lemons and limes. Peel them, cut into halves or quarters (depending on your blender&rsquo;s ability to blend up big or small chunks), and put in your Ziplock bag. With organic lemons or limes only (otherwise there are chemicals all over the outside peel), I like to grate the lemon zest into my smoothies for an extra lemon taste that promotes healing. Believe it or not, there is extra nutrition in the peel!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can even freeze your avocados! No need to waste avocados anymore that have gone from unripe to too ripe. Once soft and ready to eat, cut the avocado in half, take out the pit, spoon avocado out into individualized Ziplock bags, or in a container, and store in the freezer, Use as needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the avocado is cut in half and pitted, use a spoon and go along the whole edge of the avocado to get the green meat out in a clean sweep, without a speck of avocado left behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are just some of the recipes in the BRAND NEW Gracious Living Lifestyle Healing Series E-books with accompanying videos. My passion is helping others heal and prevent diseases, and live the life of their dreams, by eating as clean as possible. The cleaner we eat, the better our bodies and brains work, giving us clarity and focus to better handle life&rsquo;s stresses and move in the direction of our limitless potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These eBooks contain some of my favorite raw food recipes designed to heal the body rapidly. They are super easy, delicious, and nutrient dense. These recipes were chosen to show you that healthy eating does not have to be complicated or require hours in the kitchen. There are so many variations you can do with these simple, healing recipes. Every recipe includes ingredients that help your cells thrive and work to the best of their ability. The beauty of these ingredients is that they are versatile and easy to use in different kinds of recipes, sweet or savory. We are not only learning to become efficient inside of our bodies, but we are also learning to become more efficient in the kitchen!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to learn more, feel better, and have fun in the kitchen?

Mason jar salads are an awesome way to create your own masterpiece. You can use a whole array of fresh and local ingredients to make a delicious work of art. From experience, using plastic containers can lead to soggy vegetables and salad. More and more people are turning to mason jars as they are environmentally friendly and maintain the freshness of the salad. Canning jars have so many great uses from smoothies on the go to piling them high with veggies. Try to find a wider mouth mason jar so it&rsquo;s easier for you to get all of the salad ingredients inside. Meal prepping on a Sunday is a great way to save time during the week. There is no need to vacuum seal the mason jars.

Coconut oil is well known for its anti-bacterial and anti- inflammatory benefits which helps to reduce inflammation, reduce scar tissue, heal burns and can be used internally to aid digestion and any viral infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Egyptians and Greeks have used honey, on the other hand, for thousands of years for baths, food and for healing burns. As found in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2032114\">research</a>, over 100 superficial burn injuries, honey has many uses:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A total of 104 cases of superficial burn injury were studied to assess the efficiency of honey as a dressing in comparison with silver sulfadiazine gauze dressing. In the 52 patients treated with honey, 91 percent of wounds were rendered sterile within 7 days. In the 52 patients treated with silver sulfadiazine, 7 percent showed control of infection within 7 days. Healthy granulation tissue was observed earlier in patients treated with honey (mean 7.4 versus 13.4 days). Of the wounds treated with honey, 87 percent healed within 15 days as against 10 per cent in the control group. Relief of pain, a lower incidence of hypertrophic scar and post-burn contracture, low cost and easy availability make honey an ideal dressing in the treatment of burns.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honey aids in increased cell generation by protecting the wound from external foreign particles and giving the skin a good layer of protection. Due its high nutrient quantity, it provides one with essentials vitamins and minerals that escalates the healing process. For our vegan friends, you may replace the honey ingredient with coconut nectar in this recipe, but you will lose some of the&nbsp;anti-inflammatory and immune boosting healing properties.</p>\r\n",

When I was growing up, I loved anything that was chewy, sweet, and colorful. My favorite snack was fruit roll ups. Sadly, as many of you have read over the years, companies label children&#39;s snacks as natural but then fill those snacks with processed sugars, preservatives, and additives. Fruit snacks from the supermarket can also get costly, so why not make your own at home?

This is a wonderful superfood to give your children for their health and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These fruit roll-ups can be made ahead of time and placed in an airtight container in the fridge.

All of these benefits and every ingredient is vegan, gluten-free, grain-free, nut-free, and easily made 100% organic by choosing organic coconut milk and Sunbutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is an approximate breakdown of the smoothie&rsquo;s macronutrients:</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:591px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"height:20px;

But I&rsquo;m also not going to encourage my kids to gorge themselves on sweets that will not only change their personalities in a negative way but will also make them sick, suppress their immune systems, and lead to tooth decay or obesity. {z438wufu}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My children&rsquo;s pediatrician said his largest spike in office visits occurs the week or two following Halloween because all that sugar leads to a drop in immunity. I did a little research on this issue, and sure enough, refined sugar does not do a body good in terms of the body&rsquo;s ability to prevent and fight infection. In fact, consuming processed white sugar <a href=\"http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/feeding-eating/family-nutrition/sugar/harmful-effects-excess-sugar\">can reduce the body&rsquo;s ability to fight germs</a> by 40%. That&rsquo;s a big YIKES for moms! The last thing we need is for our little ones to come down with a whopper of a cold. Granted, sometimes catching a cold is unavoidable. But shouldn&rsquo;t we try to stack the cards in our kids&rsquo; favor as often as possible?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/IMG_1406-booberry-nnorman-horizontal2_FEATURED.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:221px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:370px\" />So here&rsquo;s the trick (in the form of a treat).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While you might not be able to eliminate the massive wave of candy coming your way during the holidays, you can focus on adding in healthy sweets that keep your family nourished and satisfied. That way, they&rsquo;ll have less room for the bad stuff. And the bonus is that this works for parents, too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve never been tempted to eat Halloween candy for breakfast. It&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m not judging. I&rsquo;ve been there. But now you can make simple, fast, and easy desserts that are packed with nutrition and keep you full for hours. And they&rsquo;re not just for dessert! Enjoy this raw vegan BooBerry FroYo any time of day. I love the blend of healthy fruit carbs with filling plant-based protein, which helps to tell our brains that we are full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This BooBerry FroYo is one of the simplest ways for you to serve up some Sunwarrior. All you have to do is get creative with the presentation, and you&rsquo;re well on your way to winning over your kids&rsquo; imaginations. Even better? Let them help!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more you get kids involved in preparing their own foods, the more you give them a sense of control and choice. I know my kids love that. Sometimes I just leave out platters of fresh fruits and vegetables on the kitchen table and let them choose what they like, combining it however they choose to. The same theory applies with this recipe. You can set out little bowls filled with cacao nibs, ground pistachios, mini celery sticks, banana slices, and blueberries to let them design all sorts of creatures!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The holidays can be healthy AND fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy this recipe! And don&rsquo;t ever fear the effects of Halloween again.</p>\r\n",

What better way to cool off on a hot summer day than a cold soup. But cooling off is not just a summertime activity. After a good workout, a cool meal can be a refreshing reward! This gorgeous and velvety soup has no cream and no dairy, making it perfect for vegans. This soup is bursting with farm fresh flavors from the beautiful and gentle taste of the dill, parsley, and basil. The avocado and tahini add a richness to the soup while the cucumber adds hydration. The best part is that this recipe is insanely easy to make and only takes a few ingredients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/avocado%20soup%202_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cucumbers are made up of almost 95 percent of water. I love eating them because they keep me feeling hydrated and fresh. Cucumbers work wonders on oral health, as they are able to fight odor-causing bacteria in your mouth. They can also help in digestive health by raising our stomachs PH levels which tend to be very acidic most of the time. Cucumbers can also help maintain a healthy weight in the body as they contain only 16 calories per cup! They slow digestion in the body due to their fiber content, so it&rsquo;s a great healthy snack which will keep you feeling full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We add a touch of tahini to give this soup its extra &ldquo;oomph&rdquo; and flavor. Being rich in minerals and calcium, tahini has many great health benefits. Tahini is also rich in healthy fats contributing to healthy skin and glow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This soup can be made the night before and placed in the fridge. It will keep around 2&ndash;3 days in an airtight container.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you seeing weird numbers and letters? Find out why&nbsp;<a href=\"/rewards\">here</a>!</p>\r\n",

Avoid fruits with an abundance of black freckles on the skin. Push gently against the skin with your thumb. It&#39;s ready when it gives slightly to gentle pressure; it may also have a fruity aroma on the stem end. To ripen a mango, keep it at room temperature so it can become not only softer but also sweeter. To accelerate the ripening process, place it in a brown paper bag for a few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Refrigerate ripe mangos. When uncut, they can keep for about 3&ndash;5 days. One cup of mangos has about 100 calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are many benefits of eating mango, a small percentage of people are known to suffer from mango allergy symptoms. This is due to the presence of the irritant urushiol in mango sap and peel. Mango allergies commonly result in itching and burning around the mouth, with swelling of lips. One way to help prevent a mango allergy reaction is to wash the area of your body with soap and water which has come into contact with mango sap.</p>\r\n",

This coconut pumpkin pie fluff is just the level!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Not sure if it was Sunday afternoon boredom, a longing to escape unpleasant tasks, or my body&rsquo;s innate wisdom for an antioxidant infusion. But I made a trek to the kitchen, took a quick inventory of the pantry items on hand that could be transformed into something better, and this dish was my result. A delish creamy concoction of comforting flavors that dance on the taste buds in provocative whispers and layers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/01/coconut%20pumpkin_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all know pumpkin plays really well with the warming spices: ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Toss in vanilla and orange and voila, taste sensations! Caramel sweetness comes from rich unsweetened apple butter (not applesauce,) or pureed, rehydrated Medjool dates work well, too. My fave all the way is the apple butter, so it&rsquo;s the one featured here. There are many health benefits to this recipe: chia delivers a great dose of omega 3 essential fatty acids as well as protein, calcium, and iron. Pumpkin is a great prebiotic, which feeds probiotics, the healthy bacteria we hear about all the time. The spices are anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, health benefits are all fine and dandy, but taste matters most. Make this, and I trust you will agree. The recipe is easily doubled given I only was using half cans. Make a double batch and freeze in portion-sizes. Outside of a little texture change, it will keep in the freezer a week or two (depending on your freezer and how often it&rsquo;s opened and closed).</p>\r\n",

This is all about keeping snacktime healthy!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a kid, I used to LOVE those chewy granola bars. What was your favorite flavor? Mine was a toss-up between the smore&rsquo;s and the peanut butter chip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the kids are back in school, I thought I would recreate a healthy version of these chewy granola bars. These are perfect for little ones (or the young at heart) that need to stick to a gluten free diet, but don&rsquo;t want to feel ostracized with &ldquo;weird&rdquo; or &ldquo;different&rdquo; lunch and snack options. Man, the school cafeteria can be a rough place! {zrx89r5}</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/chewy%20granola%20bar_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These granola bars include gluten-free quick oats to give density and chewiness to the bars. Quick oats are a great source of carbohydrates. The carbs help replenish glycogen stores, giving you energy, which makes it a perfect pick-me-up snack! This would even be a great snack to pack in your gym bag as an effective post-workout meal. Add some protein, like a Sunwarrior protein shake, and you are good to grow!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To give the granola bars some crunch, the recipe includes gluten free rice crisps. This keeps the recipe light and calorie friendly for those concerned with macro breakouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These bars are naturally sweetened, unlike those highly processed ones you would find in the store. The recipe uses brown rice syrup and honey, although you can certainly use maple syrup to keep it vegan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coconut oil is also used as a binder. For this reason, these bars are best kept intact in the refrigerator. Coconut oil is really unique because it expands as it cools. If left out on the counter for too long, the binding will start to break down and the bars will fall apart very easily. They are best consumed soon after taking them out of the fridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the add-in options to customize the flavorings!</p>\r\n",

For this salad, you can choose whichever vegetables you desire such as beets, carrots, capsicums, zucchini, micro greens, and sprouts! Fall harvest is the best time to go find out what is in season at your local farmers market and use it for salads. Salads don&rsquo;t need to be boring; you can add different grains such as quinoa, faro, or couscous to make it a complete meal. You can also add slices of fresh avocado or raw nuts to give it a boost of healthy fats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/beet%20pad%20thai_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We tend to eat with our eyes before eating with our mouths. When you serve bright and colorful foods, serve them on white dishes. It makes the color pop, and they become more inviting to eat. Salads come in various textures, flavors, shapes, sizes, and colors which make them visually beautiful. The experience of eating food is all about the visual appearance. The better the food looks, the better it tends to taste. More and more people are creating salads in mason jars and clear containers as this gives us the visualization of beautiful and fresh foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salads not only decrease our overall calorie intake for the day, but they also add a whole array of nutrients and fiber to our diet. By adding more salads to our daily diets, our bodies can become more alkaline and have better energy levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most salads, the dressing is the hero in the recipe. We use a blend of nut butter, miso, and herbs to give it a mix of sweet and salty. This recipe yields a large meal which can be stored in the fridge for leftovers the day after.</p>\r\n",

Classic or Classic Plus work best here, but the others will do in a pinch, too (they might need another tablespoon or two of almond milk to get the texture right). Add a quarter teaspoon cinnamon, one teaspoon baking powder, half a cup of rolled oats, and your flax egg. Mix it up real good. Add some stevia if you like to make it sweeter or a tablespoon of maple syrup. You can add other extracts too, like vanilla, strawberry, peach, lemon, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grease your griddle with coconut oil, and pour those pancakes on over medium to medium-low heat.

This is a crucial step that you don&rsquo;t want to miss! It adds so much more depth to the flavor of this dish. I put mine in the toaster oven at 400 degrees and turned as each side cooked and charred. This process is usually complete by the time the potatoes are done cooking. Remove from cooking source and let cool slightly, peel off skin, and cut into thin slices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drain tender potatoes and place into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Mash potatoes and slightly let cool. When slightly cooled, add cheeses, salt, and pepper, sliced up poblano pepper, salsa. You may add a dash of milk if you want, but you want the mixture to be firm. The cheese and salsa are usually enough. Set aside, do not mix together yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heat a large skillet on the stove over med heat, lay tortilla flat and slightly warm up. Just enough that they bend easily (usually a minute or so).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With clean hands mix up potato mixture, that&rsquo;s right, with your hands! Mix until really mashed together!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add enough mixture into each tortilla shell to make your taco!

While the rice is cooking to your liking, add a bit of oil to a saut&eacute; pan, and set pan on medium heat. To your pan, add white onion, shredded carrots, and saut&eacute; for about five minutes. Just get those onions looking nice and clear. Now throw in black beans and whatever else you can think of to make this bowl a colorful dish of nutrition. We added broccoli to get a little green in there, but use whatever you&rsquo;d like. Keep on a low heat just long enough to get the beans and veggies nice and hot. In a separate small bowl, add a cup of your favorite hummus. And yes, there are tons of amazing options out there. Tomato basil, jalapeno, roasted red pepper, plain, whatever; the list goes on and on! Yes, hummus is that good. It pretty much deserves its own aisle in the grocery store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To your hummus, add curry powder and sour cream. We used a fancy vegan sour cream, but work with what you got. Give that concoction a good stir then plop it on top of your rice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add your bean and veggie mixture then top it off with avocado.

How about adding it to you morning hot cereal!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, is there anything better than pumpkin? As soon as the first leaves turn color, people become pumpkin obsessed. And for good reason. Not only is pumpkin comforting and decadent, this seasonal superfood is actually a really healthy add-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/pumpkin%20pie%20hot%20cereal_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pumpkin is a great source of carotenoids, including beta-carotene. As with other orange-colored fruits and vegetables, pumpkin is rich in these antioxidants, which the body converts into Vitamin A. These nutrients help the body maintain healthy skin, keen vision, and a well-tuned heart. Carotenoids are also studied for their ability to prevent cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fibrous insides of a pumpkin make it stand to reason that pumpkin is also an excellent source of fiber. Foods high in fiber help us feel fuller for longer. Fiber also aids in weight loss, making recipes with added pumpkin (like this one) a healthy choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pumpkin is loaded with potassium. For those who enjoy an active lifestyle, potassium helps the body recover after a workout. Potassium does this by balancing the body&rsquo;s electrolytes and keeps muscles functioning properly. But even for those who don&rsquo;t enjoy a healthy active lifestyle, everyone needs potassium. It&rsquo;s essential for heart function, and adding potassium into the diet is associated with a reduced risk of stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating your own pumpkin puree is ideal. But, canned pumpkin is a really great choice, too. Just make sure that you do not use a canned pumpkin pie mix, as this contains added preservatives and sugars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This hot cereal breakfast gives you all the macro-nutrients you need. It has protein, courtesy of the <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-vanilla-1kg\" target=\"_blank\">Sunwarrior Warrior Blend protein</a>. It contains carbohydrates, found in the steel cut oats. And it has healthy fats in the coconut oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to get an adequate amount of protein and carbohydrates, especially in the morning. To prevent fatigue, boost energy, and fuel our systems, our bodies need those macro-nutrients to get going in the morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making this recipe ahead of time gives you one less thing to do on a busy morning. Such a great grab-and-go breakfast option!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aroma of the spices makes this hot cereal extra comforting and particularly fall appropriate. The velvety texture feels like a custard or pie filling, but it is totally healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So go ahead and jump on the pumpkin band-wagon!</p>\r\n",

Muffins, cereals, and yogurt are awesome choices, but pancakes are even better. Corn meal pancakes are absolutely delicious and gluten free. Pancakes should be fluffy, light, and flavorful. These pancakes are all of the above. These blue pancakes are a delightful spin on the usual classic with more flavors and texture that will leave you wanting seconds!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/blue%20cornmeal%20pancakes_FEATURED.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:670px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornbread is one of the best comfort foods, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be unhealthy. These corn pancakes are a great twist on the classic flavors of cornbread. Cornmeal is corn that has been ground up to create a flour-like consistency. Cornmeal contains a large amount of unsaturated fats and fiber. I used blue cornmeal in this recipe. Corn has gotten a bad reputation over the years. Most of the corn used in North America is highly refined, processed, and is genetically modified. Unlike its yellow counterpart, blue corn meal is easier to find in a non GMO version, especially if you&rsquo;re looking in your local health food store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best reasons to use blue corn meal is its anti-cancer properties. Just like blackberries and blueberries, blue corn meal contains a high amount of antioxidants. Blue corn also has a slower rate of starch digestion which leads to a lower spike in your glycemic index. This means that you will stay full longer and won&rsquo;t gain excess pounds due to high spikes in your sugar levels (such as happens with yellow corn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pancakes don&rsquo;t need to be limited to breakfast. They are awesome as lunch or even dinner! Pair these up with fresh syrup such as maple, honey, or brown rice syrup. Add nuts or seeds and fruit. Be creative with your pancakes and craft a masterpiece with your favorite flavors and toppings.</p>\r\n",

		"articleBodyHTML" : "<h2>Ever had a BLT sandwich vegan style? (Which, of course, means IN style!)&nbsp;Then have we got some tasty happiness waiting for you!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe was inspired from one of my favorite vegan bakeries in Toronto. I decided to experiment and see if I could replicate the taste and flavor myself using a few simple ingredients that I found in the health food store. The &ldquo;B&rdquo; or &ldquo;bacon&rdquo; flavor in this recipe comes from the smoked coconut chips. The bakery smokes their own coconut chips, and since I have no smoker, I found these wonderful BBQ coconut chips in the health food store that I think compare to the real thing. This recipe is very simple since all the ingredients, minus the vegan mayonnaise, requires zero preparation time. Well maybe besides washing and slicing the vegetables (&ldquo;L &ndash; Lettuce&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;T &ndash; Tomato&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2016/06/Mary%20Luciano%20August%202016%20-%20BLT_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I bought a small loaf of the bakeries gluten-free bread which they make in-house and is truly delicious. However any gluten-free sliced bread will do.&nbsp; The vegan mayonnaise is not the true version that the bakery makes so I had to improvise, seeing that I don&rsquo;t know the recipe for their secret mayo sauce.&nbsp; Equally as tasty is my version below. If you don&rsquo;t have time to make a batch, you can purchase one from the health food store and use that instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe will pleasantly surprise any &ldquo;real&rdquo; BLT lover.&nbsp; Give it a try and see for yourself.</p>\r\n",

Oats are one of the healthiest foods on this planet. Oats can be a perfect way to kick start the day or to made into cookies and bars. Oat flour is a great way to create healthy treats. Oat flour has a delicious nutty flavor but boasts an array of nutritional value that traditional flour lacks. Oat flour tends to be lighter and sweeter than refined white flour. Since we are using gluten free oats, this flour is gluten free which is easier for our digestive systems.

Colder months can also mean lively, bright, hearty, and healthy food options. The best way to incorporate all of these key nutrients into your diet is soup. You can add an array of vegetables, herbs and spices to liven it up. Eating soup is a quick and hot meal that can be prepared in no time.

During winter months, red peppers are an amazing way to heat our internal core. These crisp and vibrant vegetables activate thermogenesis in the body which can increase metabolism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe calls for Harissa which is a wonderful spice.

Add the cinnamon, turmeric, clove, cardamom and vanilla bean, as well as the pod, into the milk. To maximize the vanilla bean, you want to cut the pod in half, lengthwise. Scrape out all of the oily seeds from the inside to use in the recipe. You will have flecks of vanilla throughout, which will infuse the milk with vanilla. Once cut, throw the whole pod and the oily seeds you scraped out earlier, into the coconut milk. The most efficient way to get the flavor from the vanilla is to add it to something warm, which helps to disperse the seeds and the oils. Mix the ingredients using a whisk.&nbsp; Infuse the milk for 3 to 4 minutes of simmering.</li>\r\n\t<li>In a blender add the raw cashews, young coconut meat, maple syrup, chia seeds, salt, DoTERRA On Guard and the infused coconut milk (if you have added the spices whole make sure to strain the milk first).

Everybody has his or her own version of the all-American dish, which is typically made con carne or with meat. I&rsquo;m lightening it up and making it meat-free, bean-free, vegan, and raw. This easier-to-digest version is packed with surprisingly authentic chili flavor from sun-dried tomatoes, avocado, lime, carrots, and traditional chili spices. My recipe is also different in that it does not call for cooking or heating. Where you might otherwise spend a couple hours simmering, this version is prepared in a high-speed blender.

Dried figs are a great source of energy. They contain natural sugar but when paired up with the pumpkin seeds, the natural sugar won&rsquo;t spike your blood sugar because the two counterbalance each other. Figs are rich in fiber which can aid in digestive problems or constipation. Figs also contain less sugar than dates. Figs also have fewer calories than dates, which give them the leg up in this recipe. When making this recipe, soak the figs in boiling water for 30&ndash;40 minutes prior to blending them. The figs will plump up and give the bars a more smooth texture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use carob chips in this recipe, but you can always opt to use regular chocolate chips.

This salad can be modified to suit you or your guests&rsquo; needs. You can add whichever vegetables or fruits are in season or switch out certain grains to add texture, flavor, or taste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The base of this salad is millet. Millet is not a common grain seen on tables, but it&rsquo;s making a dent in North American diets. Millet grain, common in India, is a source of key nutrients. Millet boosts an array of health benefits such as improving the digestive system and detoxifying the body and is a wonderful source of plant-based protein that can help repair muscles after exercising. Millet is rich in fiber which can help in bloating, constipation, and regulating our digestive problems. Millet can also lower our cholesterol levels leading to good heart health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We added roasted tofu to this recipe to give this salad a boost of nutrients and added protein. You can omit the tofu and add any other protein of choice. This salad can be made ahead of time and placed in the fridge up to five days. Make a large batch, and eat away!</p>\r\n",

Peanut Butter and chocolate together. With these peanut butter chocolate dream cookies, these two love birds mesh together to create a masterpiece. This version of a peanut butter cup is made with only a handful of ingredients and without gluten, refined sugars or additives. They are better than store bought cookies and are one hundred times healthier. These peanut butter cups are so much fun to make, and they are delicious if you dunk them in a giant glass of almond milk. These peanut butter cups require no baking and minimal cleanup!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Chocolate%20Dreams_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use natural peanut butter in this recipe instead of regular peanut butter. When you take a stroll in the supermarket in the peanut butter isle, you will notice an abundance of nut butters. We see smooth, crunchy, chocolate, or even festive flavors brought in during seasonal times. The problem with most of these brands is that there is an abundance of additives such as salt, sugar, and hydrogenated oils. When you purchase, natural peanut butter is where it&rsquo;s at. You want 100% peanuts without additives. Many retailers now even have machines that allow you to grind your own nuts into nut butter. This goes for cashews, almonds, and peanuts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best ways to make these peanut butter cups is using a muffin tray. All you need to do is oil the inside of each slot and place peanut mixture inside. Pop in the freezer and remove. Drizzle with delicious chocolate and voila! If you have silicon molds, these will pop out very easily. These peanut butter cups can be made ahead of time and placed in the freezer in an airtight container. These peanut butter cups are a great gift giving idea.</p>\r\n",

When I first tasted coconut meat fresh from the coconut itself, I instantaneously fell in love with it! It is amazing how many creative dishes you can make with coconut meat, and it&rsquo;s a great substitute for dairy. If you are vegan, have an allergy to dairy, or are choosing to limit dairy, this alternative is for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the probiotics, I use Friendly Flora by Health Force Nutritionals. It has a whopping 100 billion organisms per teaspoon. Make sure to do a probiotic check to make sure it is dairy free if you are vegan or sensitive to dairy.

Most store-bought cheesecakes are commercially prepared, so there is a huge number of saturated fats. Saturated fats are to be blamed for elevated cholesterol in your blood which can lead to heart disease and stroke. The base for this cheesecake is cashews which have a high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids which helps with reducing blood pressure and helps prevent weight loss. Cashews also contain lutein which is found in carrots. Lutein helps with eye sight and keeps eyes protected from light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The base of the cheesecake is also made with dates and raw nuts. Since the dates are naturally sweet, we reduce the amount of sugar in the entire recipe. Dates also boost a large amount of fiber which makes them the best natural sweetener around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This cheesecake takes a little bit of time to make, but I promise it is worth it. One of the best parts of this recipe is that it can be made weeks ahead of time and stored in the freezer in an air tight container. All you need to do is take it out and let it thaw for a few hours then top it with additional fruits or coconut whip cream.</p>\r\n",

Instead of growing your waistline, grow your health and love for the people around you. Change things around this year by surprising your loved one with a superfood protein shake that will energize them the entire day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/valentine%20shake_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This protein-packed smoothie is filled with super foods. It contains chia seeds, hemp seeds, Camu Camu powder, <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/classic-plus-chocolate-1kg\">Sunwarrior Classic chocolate protein</a>, cacao, and lucuma. Chia seeds are high in fiber and are packed with protein. Chia seeds help to keep you fuller longer as they expand in your stomach after ingested. Hemp hearts are rich in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. Hemp hearts are one of nature&rsquo;s most perfect and well-balanced foods. They help with weight loss, sustain energy levels, reduce inflammation, and contain more protein (when compared gram for gram) than chicken. These hemp hearts are very easy for the stomach to digest therefore we rapidly reap all of the benefits&nbsp;after being consumed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Camu powder is one of those mysterious ingredients that we hear or see in recipes or in health food supermarkets. Camu Camu is a fruit that has one of the highest concentrations of vitamin c in the world. It also has an impressive amount of iron and calcium. Camu is rich in vitamin c and can help balance out hormone levels which are nature&rsquo;s natural antioxidant. Lastly, lucuma is a natural sweetener. It is derived from a fruit just like Camu Camu. It can sweeten foods without raising blood sugar levels. This is the perfect sweetener for individuals who suffer from diabetes. Lucuma is rich in fiber which can help the digestive system function properly. Lucuma powder is wonderful to bake with as it replaces the need for refined sugars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This superfood smoothie is guaranteed to give you an extra surge of energy to enjoy a fun filled day with loved ones.</p>\r\n",

DIY your valentine gift by making your own chocolate for your loved ones this year!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Valentine&rsquo;s Day is a time for love, sweetness, and chocolates of course! Store bought chocolates are wonderful and sweet, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be sweeter to make your own special chocolates for the ones you love? Valentine&rsquo;s Day is that one time a year where giving the gift of an entire box of chocolates is totally acceptable. But how many people know that making their own chocolate is very simple. All you need to do is melt down the cocoa butter, add a little touch of maple syrup and voila. You can add cocoa powder, cocoa nibs, sea salt, fruits or nuts. Depending on what your valentine preferences, you can personalize these chocolates to their liking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Heart_chocolate__MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raw cocoa butter is 100 pure and obtained from the cocoa bean. It is rich and velvety without all of the added chemicals white chocolate has. Cocoa is high in antioxidants and healthy fats which will give you a boost of energy. Cacao butter is naturally rich in omega 6 and 9 which can support an overall better health and well-being. Cacao butter looks like white chocolate when you purchase it, and it has the same mouth feel. Store-bought white chocolate is filled with added sugars and chemicals. These homemade chocolates are naturally sweetened, vegan, gluten-free, and there are no added ingredients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can buy as an assortment of molds to experiment. Since it&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day, heart shape molds can be found at many retailers, but you can also mold them into squares or bars. Silicon baking molds are highly recommended for this recipe as they are easy to remove. These freeze very well. You can make a big batch, pop them in the freezer and have a guilt free dessert after dinner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These chocolates are not only rich and decadent, but they are also creamy and simple to make!&nbsp; These chocolates are what dreams are made of. We promise that these chocolates will lead to a cascade of hugs, kisses, and cuddles.</p>\r\n",

It warms your insides, making the outside cold something pleasant. But making steel cut oats in the morning for your kids before they go to school is sometimes not possible. And eating just a plain bowl of quick oats gets a little boring for everyone. Sure, you can mix it up a bit, but it still takes time that might be better spent elsewhere.

It will only take a few minutes. You can cook this in a smaller crockpot (3 or 4 quarts) or if you have a larger one, just mix the ingredients in a bowl that will fit in your crockpot and add water up &frac34; of the way up the bowl. I find that cooking the oats in the bowl actually makes the oats not cook so fast and so you can cook the oats all night long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also an excellent way to use up old apples that aren&rsquo;t bad but don&rsquo;t really look good. Just chop them up and add them in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What isn&rsquo;t there to love about apples and cinnamon? Apples give you much-needed fiber and vitamin C to help fight off colds.

We&rsquo;ve got the recipe for magic!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are Flavanols?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flavanols are natural plant-based phytochemical compounds found in various types of plants. These serve as antioxidants and provide a number of health benefits. Cocoa flavanols are particularly beneficial, which comes in handy this Valentine&rsquo;s Day as they can be quite delicious, too. With all of the Valentine&rsquo;s chocolate consumption, it&rsquo;s nice to know you may be promoting your health! Be careful, though. Often times, the manufacturing involved with that chocolate bar may have taken out up to 80% of the health-aiding flavanols. To reap the promised health advantages of cocoa, make sure you know your flavanol facts! If you&rsquo;re going to get your cocoa flavanols in chocolate, the darker the chocolate=the higher the amount of cocoa flavanols. When considering dark chocolates or cocoa powders, make sure it contains at least 50&ndash;80% of cocoa to actually contain enough flavanols to effectively boost those health benefits!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/cacao%20chocolate%20bark_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Health Benefits of Cocoa Flavanols</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Promotes Circulatory Health&nbsp; Maintaining a healthy circulatory system is vital for optimum overall health. Your circulatory system delivers oxygen and nutrients throughout your body, and cocoa flavanols encourage the blood vessels and arteries to stay flexible in order to adequately maintain cardiovascular health. Cocoa raises the nitric oxide levels within the body, widening your blood vessels and therefore assisting in lowering blood pressure and risk of stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Natural Workout Supplement</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This nitric oxide boost also makes it quite alluring to athletes for the workout benefits. The decreases stress on your circulatory system enables muscles to function and recover better. This increased rate at which the muscles can recover and repair damaged muscle tissue allows for a decrease in the soreness felt between workouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Contains Ample Antioxidants</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No surprise here. The more antioxidants your body gets, the more you are warding off disease. Antioxidants target harmful free radicals in your bloodstream that may trigger disease or even cancer. Eliminating those risks by supplying your body with enough antioxidants is something we can all cheer for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Helps Prevent Cognitive Decline and Possibly Dementia</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cocoa flavanols increase blood flow to the brain, which often decreases with age. By keeping up this healthy blood flow, you&rsquo;re promoting healthy brain function, aiding in learning and memory, as well as reducing your risks for serious complications later in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Assists in Curing Fatigue and Sleep Deprivation</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the outstanding benefits to your circulatory system, cocoa flavanols are said to assist in curing insomnia or other issues related to sleep deprivation. A healthy heart and blood pressure will help stop those restless nights tossing and turning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Can Lower Bad Cholesterol</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plant compounds specific to cocoa flavanols prevent LDL cholesterol (&lsquo;bad&rdquo; cholesterol) from oxidizing. When LDL cholesterol is oxidized, it gets exposed to free radicals and produces inflammation in your arteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Improved Mood and Libido</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the cocoa flavanols ability to raise the levels of pleasure neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and phenylethylamine), it is said to be one of nature&rsquo;s natural aphrodisiacs and mood enhancers. Phenylethylamine, or PEA, produces chemicals in the brain that are associated with falling in love. There&rsquo;s no secret why a holiday associated with love is connected with so much chocolate! Furthermore, serotonin and dopamine are neurotransmitters proven to lift a person&rsquo;s mood and relax the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the health benefits cocoa flavanols provide, you don&rsquo;t have to feel too guilty about treating yourself and your Valentine to that chocolate. Just remember, to reap the optimal benefits, you do want to ensure you&#39;re consuming a treat with at least 50-80% of cocoa flavanols, and be mindful of the caloric intake. If you can&rsquo;t find a chocolate treat containing the desired high levels of cocoa flavanols, you can always make it yourself! There are plenty of delicious recipes that provide the benefits of cocoa flavanols without all of the unnecessary additives and calorie-soaring extras. For a sweet and healthy way of including cocoa flavanols in your diet, check out this recipe!</p>\r\n",

And, what better way to showcase this healthy citrus, than with a fresh snack?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The peak of grapefruit season begins around Christmas and continues through April. Florida and Texas produce the most grapefruits in the U.S. Because grapefruits are low in calories and lower on the glycemic index, they are an ideal fruit for weight loss. Grapefruits will not spike your blood sugar or insulin levels the way some fruits will. The reason grapefruit is touted for weight loss is its ability to speed up the metabolism. Grapefruit can help the body burn fat when the metabolism is at a revved up state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/grapefruit%20salad%20pic%20MAIN.png\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scripps Clinic &#39;Grapefruit Diet&#39; study, led by Dr. Ken Fujioka, monitored the weight and metabolic factors of 91 obese men and women for 12 weeks.1 Each participant was randomly assigned to one of four groups to receive either placebo capsules along with 7 ounces of apple juice, grapefruit capsules with 7 ounces of apple juice, 8 ounces of grapefruit juice with a placebo capsule or half of a fresh grapefruit with a placebo capsule three times a day before each meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 12 weeks, the fresh grapefruit group had lost the most weight at 3.52 lbs, the grapefruit juice group had lost 3.3 lbs, the grapefruit capsule group had lost 2.42 lbs, and the placebo group had lost 0.66 lbs. According to the researchers, there was also a significant reduction in 2-hour post-glucose insulin level in the grapefruit group compared with placebo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grapefruits are also packed with vitamins, vitamin A and C in particular! The combination of fiber, potassium, lycopene, vitamin C and choline found in grapefruit helps maintain a healthy heart. The beta-carotene in grapefruits also acts as an antioxidant. Your skin will benefit from all of these great vitamins and minerals too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flavonoids and phytonutrients found in grapefruit are another reason why this citrus is such a super fruit!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fruit salad would be a great choice to compliment any meal, but breakfast especially. The pineapple juice and sweetener help cut the acidity that can sometimes come with grapefruits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to point out that grapefruits can interact with certain prescription drugs adversely. Always consult your doctor to find out about any negative interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pro tip: Grapefruit can be a pain to cut sometimes, especially in the morning when we are all short on time. Here are some tips to help make cutting a grapefruit into segments less stressful. Do this the night before and store in the fridge for quick access the next morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, cut the citrus in half from top to bottom - not around the center! Lay one-half flat on the cutting board and peel the skin, leaving as much fruit as possible. Slice off the top cap of the peel. Pell away any leftover pith. Slice one segment as close to the membrane as possible and loosen the fruit to lift out the segment. Repeat for all segments.</p>\r\n",

		"articleBodyHTML" : "<h2>We give you homemade bread happiness without the hassle! Bread should rock,&nbsp;not be a rock, and this bread totally rocks!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, fresh homemade bread is the most comforting food in the world. However making it 100% whole wheat is so difficult. Whole-wheat flour is full of many nutrients like fiber and protein that are good for your diet, but why is it so hard to make bread that isn&rsquo;t as heavy as a rock? I&rsquo;ve searched for years trying to find a recipe that doesn&rsquo;t produce a heavy loaf. I&rsquo;ve tried countless recipes and always ending up with a rock of a loaf that no one wants to eat. So I just resolved myself to just using mostly whole-wheat and only a little white flour so the loaves aren&rsquo;t so heavy and are edible. Finally, after years of searching, I have found a delicious loaf!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Bread1_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When making bread, one of the most important rules to know is adding too much flour will result in a heavy loaf. It is important to add just enough flour so the dough is tacky but still soft. Also adding the wheat gluten helps create a lighter loaf as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that makes this recipe a winner, I think, is that you weigh the flour. You don&rsquo;t just add cup after cup. Most of the time you will not need all the flour listed. When I made it the first time, I used a little more than half of the flour listed, but your results will vary. It may take a few times; breads take practice, after all. But hopefully, it&rsquo;ll turn out just delicious for you as it did for me!</p>\r\n",

These are the reasons this heirloom tomato gazpacho is the best soup out there!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Heirloom tomatoes are beautiful, fragrant and delicious. You don&rsquo;t need to wait for hot summer days and nights to enjoy this bright and refreshing soup. This can be paired with a fresh loaf of ciabatta or eaten on its own. The best part about this soup is that it&rsquo;s raw, vegan, and only takes a few minutes to make. There is no heating required, so all of the delicious nutrients and enzymes enact within the soup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/tomato%20gaspacho_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This soup doesn&rsquo;t need to be pureed to be completely smooth. The beauty lays in the rustic textures of the tomatoes. You can add fresh herbs of choice such as basil, parsley, sage, tarragon or even mint. Each batch of this soup will be different colors based on the tomatoes you used. Since heirloom tomatoes can range from green to dark brown, the color and taste may change a little. You can drizzle pesto on top of the soup or even add some fresh avocado.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tomatoes are incredibly healthy for you. They are a natural source of fiber and are low in sodium and calories. Tomatoes also have a high water content, so they keep you feeling fuller longer. Tomatoes contain beta-carotene which is the same enzyme found in carrots. Beta carotene can help protect your eyes and skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When summer comes, another variation of this soup would be to add some fresh watermelon. Watermelon and tomatoes are always in abundance during the summer, so why not mixed them together? This soup is perfect for family get-togethers, which means you will definitely want to tuck this recipe away for the summer when picnic season starts up (and definitely try the watermelon version)!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you blend all of the ingredients together, let this soup sit in the fridge for an hour or two to really absorb the flavors. Add a few chili peppers to give it heat, and you have the perfect soup.</p>\r\n",

So a very merry unbirthday to you as we learn about this amazing mushroom (unless it is your birthday, in which case, happy birthday!)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is Chaga?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all the superfood fads out there these days, you may be wondering to yourself, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this buzz about chaga?&rdquo; Known in Russia as &ldquo;a gift from God,&rdquo; this amazing mushroom is found growing on live birch trees, mainly in Siberia, Asia, and other Northern climates. It is touted as a high-powered immunomodulator and adaptogen, meaning that it not only boosts your immune system, but it also comes to the aid of any system in the body that may be lacking vitality and proper function. It is one of the richest sources of antioxidants on the planet, being extremely high in enzyme SOD which prevents premature aging and boasts being anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-tumor, and anti-bacterial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all of these amazing disease fighting and health protecting properties, it is no wonder that many people are discovering the amazing benefits of chaga!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/chaga%20pudding_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Powerful Adaptogen</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there is much to be discussed in terms of the health-promoting effects of chaga, let&rsquo;s focus in on one of the most relevant benefits that this mushroom provides as it pertains to an increasingly stress-driven and fatigue-burdened society. As an adaptogen, taking chaga as a tea or extract in powder or tincture form can have a powerful effect on the body&rsquo;s delicate balance and the interplay between organ systems. Because of chaga&rsquo;s incredible ability to balance and support the body, it has long been hailed as an anti-aging tonic by Russian, Asian, and other Eastern cultures. Scientific research has listed chaga as one of the top adaptogens on the planet, also evidenced by its positive effects on performance and overall well-being of those consuming the mushroom long term. We can make use of this wonderful life-enhancing mushroom by treating mild fatigue to full-on adrenal burnout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chaga&rsquo;s Effect on Stress</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that as a whole, the general population is affected to some degree by the ill effects of stress, whether that be from work, home, or other areas of life. The demands of everyday life can be overwhelming, leaving an individual depleted in every sense of the word. Chaga can be of much benefit in such a situation as it replenishes on a cellular level. Not only does chaga provide antioxidants as before-mentioned, but it also assists in detoxifying the liver and eliminating toxins from the body, thus increasing the metabolic process and allowing your cells to function more efficiently. As an adaptogen, there are no stimulating effects of taking chaga, yet it provides a steady source of energy to users who build upon use, meaning, that taken daily as a tonic it will continue to work on the body and address each layer needed to bring balance, without any harmful side effect. It is completely non-toxic and provides a grounding energy which can be felt on a deep cellular level. This is due largely in part to chaga&rsquo;s ability to inhibit oxidative damage to DNA and protection against other free radicals. Less stress on the cells over time will lead to a noticeable difference in an individual&rsquo;s overall well-being, such as noticeable emotional stability, physical stamina, and mental clarity, all of which help combat the negative effects of a constantly driven world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nourishing Nutrients</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is more, chaga provides high levels of many key nutrients that nourish the adrenal glands and the endocrine system as a whole. One of the key nutrients for adrenal healing, pantothenic acid, is found in high amounts in chaga. It is also high in zinc, iron, copper, and manganese, all of which stimulate SOD and provide antioxidant value. Chaga also contains a lanosterol, a precursor to human cholesterol, which supports the endocrine system by rebuilding cell membranes and providing the building blocks needed for optimal functioning. As with all adaptogens, give at least two months of consistent use to see a noticeable difference in energy levels and overall wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want a tasty, fun way to try chaga and reap the benefits of this incredible fungi? Try this Chaga Chia Pudding, complete with protein, fats, and a complex sweet-and-earthy flavor that will have you coming back for seconds.</p>\r\n",

		"authorName" : "Sheree Clark",
		"articleBodyHTML" : "<h2>Sunflower sprouts: rich in folic acid and B-complex vitamins. You can grow your own health!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunflower sprouts are a tasty superfood. These yummy young shoots are an excellent source of chlorophyll and protein, are rich in folic acid and the B-complex vitamins, vitamins C and E, selenium and zinc. They make a nutritious addition to salads and smoothies, and they juice well with cold press juicers. Dense, crunchy, &ldquo;sunnies&rdquo; are slightly nutty in flavor with a very mild hint of lemon. They can be grown indoors or outside, although birds and squirrels are attracted to them, so you will want to plan for protection if you choose to grow outdoors. Sunnies are simple to grow. Everyone adds his or her own spin to the growing process, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to experiment. It&rsquo;s hard to mess this up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Sunflower%20salad-aerial_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. For a 10&rdquo;x20&rdquo; growing tray, soak a scant cup of organic, unshelled black oil sunflower seeds for 8 hours or overnight, and then rinse and drain them. Note that whole sunflower seeds float. To get them saturated, it is necessary to keep them completely under water. A wide mouth glass canning jar works well. Place the seeds in the bottom, fill the jar to the top with water and put the two-piece lid on tight, then invert the jar, so the seeds rise to the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; of the jar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Replace the two-piece canning jar lid with a sprouting jar strainer lid and drain off soak water thoroughly. The soak water has nutrients in it and is good for watering houseplants. Rinse seeds thoroughly with cool water and drain again. Set your sprouting jar at a 45-degree angle to drain between rinses&mdash;it works well to prop it up in a dish rack. Keep the jar out of direct sunlight and at room temperature between rinses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Rinse twice a day until the seeds start to sprout. You will see a small (1/8&rdquo;) white root growing out of the sunflower seed shells. This will occur after 2&ndash;3 rinse periods; it doesn&rsquo;t take long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Fill your seed tray about 1&rdquo; deep with a good quality potting soil or compost. Some growers like to add earthworm castings to the growing medium. If you add earthworm castings, keep the ratio to less than 20% of the tray, or your sprouts may burn. Spread the soil evenly. Empty the jar with the sprouted seeds into the middle of the tray, and gently spread them out. It&#39;s fine if the seeds touch, and even if they overlap a little, but try to avoid little seed piles. If later you find any mold or fungus in your greens, reduce the amount of seed you plant. The hotter and more humid your climate is, the greater the potential for mold or fungus to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Cover the seeds with a very thin layer of soil. Water gently, once or twice a day, and keep out of direct sunlight. Be careful not to overwater, which will make them prone to mold and rot. Under-watering sprouts will stunt their growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 3&ndash;4 days, or when they are about an inch tall, move your crop to a well-lit location. If you use direct sunlight at this point, you&rsquo;ll want to plan to do a little more watering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Your sprouts are ready to harvest when their smooth seed leaves are large and green, and the second leaves have not yet appeared. They will be about 3&ndash;5 inches tall. Sunflower greens will shed their shells as their leaves open. Most of the seed husks or shells will have fallen off the sprouts by this point, but you will likely need to remove a few by hand. To remove remaining shells, tip the growing tray at an angle and brush your hand back and forth over the top of the greens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To harvest the sprouts cut off near the base with sharp, clean knife or scissors, just above the soil&rsquo;s surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Enjoy fresh sprouts in your salad or green smoothie. Stored in a produce storage bag in the refrigerator, they keep fresh for 5&ndash;7 days, providing they&#39;re almost dry, and all the husks have been removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try pairing your sprouts with a simple dressing.</p>\r\n",

But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way! I started changing one of my meals a day to a protein smoothie and found everything in my life to be so much easier. No more decisions on what to have for lunch and making sure that it had enough protein, veggies, carbs, fat, and all the rest. I just threw it all in a blender and voila! It&rsquo;s the best because it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are (driving, working, walking, etc.) you can drink it anywhere. I love knowing where my food comes from and this allows me to do just that. And the best part is it&rsquo;s so simple. Other than the convenience here are more reasons why I was inspired to make this smoothie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/smoothie%202_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chocolate is amazing, and I feel it should be included in every meal ;)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chocolate (especially dark chocolate) is a great antioxidant, contains essential vitamins and minerals, and has been associated with a TON of health benefits. Not only is it good for you, but it tastes amazing and will satisfy your sweet tooth so it can help limit those afternoon and evening cravings!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The flavors of mocha, coconut and chocolate are an excellent pick-me-up in the morning or afternoon.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mocha flavor of the <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-mocha-500g\">Sunwarrior Warrior Blend Mocha</a> along with the added cocoa makes this smoothie almost taste like your favorite coffee drink. And the best part is it provides you with the energy your body needs without any of the dreaded caffeine hangover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You can hide TONS of good-for-you vegetables into this smoothie without tasting them at all!!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intense flavors of mocha in this smoothie hide any vegetable flavor you throw in it, so feel free to go leafy-green crazy! I&rsquo;ve added frozen broccoli to this smoothie to give it a lovely smooth texture, and you can&rsquo;t even tell at all! This would be an excellent smoothie for kids or if you are just starting out with green smoothies and need a bit of time to get used to the &ldquo;green&rdquo; color or flavors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AND IT&rsquo;S CHOCOLATE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Need I say more?

Sounds familiar? It&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, of course! We decided to come up with a super green smoothie bowl to celebrate this fun and festive holiday. We snuck in lots of healthy greens to give this smoothie bowl a kick of protein, nutrients, and vitamins. Most people assume vegans lack protein in their diets, but there is an abundance of plant-based protein in the plants and vegetables that we consume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/IMG_1155_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many sources of plant-based protein that come naturally from the earth. Even if you are not plant based, adopting a one-day-a-week vegan diet can help regulate your digestive system. The fun thing about plant-based diets is that you can paint your dinner plate with a rainbow of vegetables, grains, nuts, and beans. Since our bodies can only metabolize a certain amount of protein per serving, we actually don&rsquo;t need as much as we think we do! We can utilize the power of snacking during the day to acquire protein as well as at meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quinoa is an amazing source of plant-based energy at 8 grams per cup. Green peas and artichokes both have close to 8 grams of protein. Hemp seeds pack 17 grams of protein for four tablespoons. There is hardly any weight to these little seeds which makes them very easy for your stomach to digest. Chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds, and walnuts have a high concentrations of protein. The highest protein vegetables are peas, spinach, kale, broccoli, sprouts, artichokes, edamame, and lentils.</p>\r\n",

Bite into a savory stack of awesome, now!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet, burgers can be hard for some of us to give up. Luckily, you have options when you want to swap out that all-beef patty and you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice your taste buds or your commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Mex%20closeup%20profile_MAIN%20do-over.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While &ldquo;garden burgers&rdquo; or veggie patties are a lot easier to find these days, you&rsquo;ll also find that many of them have some rather disagreeable ingredients. From texturized vegetable protein to trans-fat, and additives like sodium phosphate, nitrates, and even ammonia. You&rsquo;ll want to read the label before you make your selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An even better solution is to make your <em>own</em> burger. Many raw vegan burger recipes tend to be heavy on nuts, but I&rsquo;ve created a method that uses pumpkin seeds. Among the benefits of pumpkin seeds&mdash;sometimes called pepitas&mdash;are a nice dose of heart-healthy magnesium and a whole lot of zinc. High in fiber, pumpkin seeds also offer anti-diabetic, postmenopausal, and restfulness support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice in this recipe that we&rsquo;re using oil-packed sundried tomatoes, and I&rsquo;ve suggested you toss in a tablespoon or so of the oil itself. Do make sure any herbs or garlic added to the oil will agree with your burger mix spice blend; if no herbs have been added, that&rsquo;s fine! Down the line, after you&rsquo;ve used up all the tomatoes in your jar, be sure to save that oil! It doubles as a flavorful base for homemade salad dressing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to making a good burger, this mixture can also be used as a taco meat substitute: skip the dehydrating and use it loosely in a romaine leaf topped with a dollop of guacamole. Ol&eacute;! You&rsquo;ve got yourself a fast meal.</p>\r\n",

Spring is here which means refreshing and healthy drinks to help boost energy and refuel our bodies. This smoothie combines black currants, which are incredible sources of antioxidants, with the freshness of mint. Smoothies are a great way to pack in extra nutrition whether it&rsquo;s in the morning, midday, or at night. You can add nut butters to make it richer, switch up the milks such as rice, soy, almond, or hemp, or you can even add hemp hearts or chia seeds to boost protein. You can also add a dollop of regular or vegan yogurt to add a delicious creaminess to your shake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/black%20Currant_berry_mint_smoothie_ADOBE_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black currants are very tart, so it&rsquo;s best to combine them with other fruit to give them a more well-rounded taste. Combining black currants with additional berries (such as blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries) keeps the sugar levels low and antioxidant levels high. Black currants help fight free radicals in the body which can help stave off cancer cells. By fighting off these free radicals, it can also help in premature aging. Black currants also promote eye health and digestive health. Black currants have a huge amount of vitamin c that can also help boost immunity. This smoothie tastes fantastic with vanilla almond milk, but you can always use soy if you want a richer taste. I love the taste of fresh mint in this smoothie, but you can also use fresh basil, which gives it an incredible herbaceous taste.</p>\r\n<!-- This site is converting visitors into subscribers and customers with OptinMonster - http://optinmonster.com :: Campaign Title: Exit-Intent Recipes #2 -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"om-cc0ortdhawknvdfk-holder\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<!-- / OptinMonster -->",

The fact that these gluten-free, vegan tarts are filled with healthy ingredients is just a perk to an already perfect dessert!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As another March finishes up, that means another Easter! The snow is melting, the days are becoming sunnier, and green is pushing out of the soil and greeting the season. We want to welcome the season, too! So we created this luscious vegan and gluten free fruit tart. Your friends and family won&rsquo;t even know that it&rsquo;s healthy and guilt free! This recipe comes together very easily. The filling is great to make as a pudding on its own or to save for further use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/spring%20tart_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These individual fruit tarts are the perfect way to celebrate the coming of spring. This vegan custard is zesty from the lemons and sweet from the touch of maple. Unlike other pastry dough that takes hours to rise and set because of yeast, this one only takes 15 minutes from start to finish. This recipe used mini tart pans but no sweat, you can also use extra-large muffin tins to get the same effect. You can use an assortment of fruit for the top from strawberries, kiwis, mangoes, or whatever fruit is in season where you live. Make this tart your masterpiece, and decorate it as you please!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apricot preserves can be found at your local supermarket. It is a great way to add a sweet glaze to your tarts. Apricot preserves have a tartness yet an after note of sweetness which will compliment these tarts perfectly. If you&rsquo;ve never tried apricot preserves, it&rsquo;s a delicious breakfast idea to put on toast or muffins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best part about this recipe is that it can be eaten for dessert or for breakfast! This is a great make-ahead recipe. You can make the pie crusts a few days before, making sure to place them in air tight container and then fill them the day that you are going to eat them!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy hoppity baking!</p>\r\n",

They simply cook directly in your soup pot. They need a good hour or so, but they will break down and will blend nicely into your soup. Ever thought of thickening up your soup with cauliflower? Well, this is what happened here. Cauliflower can replace potato, flour, or any other thickener that would typically be called for or used in a soup. The cauliflower is adding in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, not to mention that cauliflower protects against cancer and heart disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Cauliflower is not your thing, then opt for sweet potatoes&ndash;this is sometimes a favorite for me as this adds a nice rich, creamy sweetness to the soup!</p>\r\n",

Although this time of year may seem difficult to be vegan, we promise it&rsquo;s easy. We decided to come up with a festive and tasty cookie sandwich that will give you the warmth of this holiday and give the added bonus of a healthy, gluten-free treat. These cookies come together in no time, and your friends and family will devour them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Eater%20cookie_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any holiday season is a time for overindulgence when it comes to sweets and desserts. In our cookies, we used brown rice flour which is a lot healthier than white rice flour in gluten-free baking. The difference between white and brown rice flour is the husk. Since the husk is still intact, it contains more fiber and vitamins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiber is such an essential part of our diets. We do receive a large amount of fiber from vegetables and other grains, but rice has insoluble fiber which can help move waste through the intestines. Since the husk is attached, brown rice flour can help make you feel fuller longer which can help in weight loss. Brown rice flour can also help in the absorption of calcium which can protect those special bones of yours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of using highly processed icing for this recipe, we used coconut butter which boasts many health benefits. Many people confuse coconut oil from coconut butter. The only difference is that coconut butter is made from the meat of the coconut while coconut oil is extracted from the coconut. Coconut butter is great for healthy hormones and high in fiber. It also contains healthy fats which will keep your energy levels high during the day. Coconut butter is a great substitute for butter in recipes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Easter-rific recipe only takes 15 minutes to make. You have to double dip the cookie sandwich to give it that extra special crunch, but we promise it is worth it.</p>\r\n",

Tahini offers a subtle nutty flavor but is a nut-free option to make dessert delicious!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first started living a plant-based lifestyle, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to do with tahini. My only knowledge regarding tahini came from a tahini lemon salad dressing I had one time that somehow progressed into a tahini-maple dressing. I never really thought there was much to it until I decided that I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of peanut butter. It wasn&rsquo;t anything bad about peanut butter; it was just too heavy sometimes! I couldn&rsquo;t imagine eating another peanut butter cookie or even putting peanut butter on an apple. It was at this point when I started experimenting with tahini and adding it into baked goods. {3ast3r} &nbsp;Man-oh-man was that an awesome idea, especially since it&rsquo;s not every day that you see tahini being used in cookie recipes! Tahini is an awesome substitute that gives cookies a more subtle nutty taste while also being nut free! Not to mention when mixed with chocolate, it becomes irresistible. These cookies were gone in no time, and I plan to make more as soon as I can get to the store for more tahini!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/tahini%20cookies%201_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that depending on which brand of tahini you use, the consistency will be thinner or thicker. The slightly thinner consistency might mean that you will need to add a little bit more flour (about 2 tablespoons) and potentially leave it in the fridge for a little bit longer to firm up. However, no matter what tahini you use, these cookies will be delicious.</p>\r\n",

I fell in love with chocolate a bit later than most people, and now it is a craving that I just can&rsquo;t ignore. But it turns out brownies don&#39;t have to be made with dairy, added sugar, and flour &ndash; all ingredients that are hard for the body to break down. Instead, I found a recipe that gives a healthy spin on your typical brownies by using chopped zucchini as a main ingredient in the batter. I know that this combination may not sound conventional, but the truth is that you can&rsquo;t taste the zucchini, and it creates a moist, cake-like consistency very similar to that of your traditional brownie! While some people make vegan brownies with avocado or black beans, zucchini brownies won&rsquo;t have the potent smell that some bean brownies have, and they won&rsquo;t be too chunky like the avocado brownies. That makes these a great choice to satisfy a true chocolate craving and get some added nutrients!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/brownie_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n",

He doesn&rsquo;t steal the show by being the life of the party, but he&rsquo;s the kind of guy you always want around because he just makes every situation better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Avocado_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But avocado actually isn&rsquo;t a guy; it&rsquo;s a fruit (a fruit?! Yeah, avocado&#39;s technically a fruit!). And because avocado is so awesome, I love to add it to just about everything!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s WHY:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Avos are filling! Their fat provides long-burning fuel which will keep you satiated longer which helps prevent you from binging on unhealthy stuff later.</li>\r\n\t<li>Avocados are a good source of B3 which can help stabilize your blood sugar and keep you from craving and caving for sugary stuff.</li>\r\n\t<li>Avocados contain a loooot of fiber which helps lubricate the digestive tract and keep you more &ldquo;regular,&rdquo; wink, wink.</li>\r\n\t<li>Avocados have some of that tryptophan (you know, that stuff that makes you tired after eating the Thanksgiving turkey), which can encourage us to relax more by supporting the release of serotonin!</li>\r\n\t<li>Avocados nourish and moisturize skin and help us maintain youthful and glowing spa-day-everyday skin. They also provide a solid source of silicon which can assist in anti-aging efforts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you sold?! Yeah, hard not to be. Now, here are nine fantastic ways to sneak &ldquo;the man&rdquo; into all sorts of daily dishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Spread avocado on toast in place of butter! (Add a sprinkle of salt or a drizzle of hot sauce.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Use avocado in sandwiches and wraps to healthfully replace the texture of mayo or cheese.</li>\r\n\t<li>Blend avocado into sauces, pestos or dressings to thicken them up without needed oils.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dice avocado and add it to salads for substance!</li>\r\n\t<li>Blend avocado into smoothies to up their creamy texture. (Great if you&#39;re avoiding sugar and don&#39;t want banana to be the texture-maker.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Roll avocado into sushi. (Or order an avocado veggie roll if you&#39;re out.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Mix avocado into dips to make them smoother and more filling.</li>\r\n\t<li>MAKE GUAC! (Ok, this is hardly &quot;sneaking&quot; avocado in, but I couldn&#39;t write about enjoying avocado without guacamole! This is my go-to guac recipe: <a href=\"http://www.partyinmyplants.com/perfect-guacamole/\">http://www.partyinmyplants.com/perfect-guacamole/</a>)</li>\r\n\t<li>Sneak avocado into homemade chocolate pudding! Seriously. You&#39;ll never know. Here&#39;s my recipe for creamy, dreamy chocolate avocado pudding:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/avocado%20pudding_avocado_chocolate_pudding_MAIN%20RECIPE.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n",

These black tahini balls are just the ticket!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These rock star energy balls are high in protein, taste incredible and delicious. Black sesame is common in many Asian desserts. It&rsquo;s super nutty and packs so many nutritional benefits. There are always new products being featured in organic health markets, and I stumbled across black sesame seed butter. I fell in love and had to create a healthy dessert with them. The result was a success, and these have been a fan favorite with family and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/AdobeStock_120759868_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black sesame butter or better known as black tahini paste is high in healthy fats and amino acids. A small amount of tahini can go a long way. Its flavors are robust, so you don&rsquo;t need much. While tahini may be high in calories, it contains an abundance of protein and benefits your skin, heart, hormones and energy levels. Many people who are on a plant-based diet tend to feel lethargic or suffer from anemia. Tahini is a great source of plant-based protein that can help with these symptoms and help boost energy levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can&rsquo;t find black sesame tahini, you can always use the regular version. Make sure you look for un-hulled and raw version. Un-hulled sesame is the raw and unprocessed version of the seed where the bran is still attached. By keeping the bran on the kernel, more nutrients are present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When compared with other nut butters, sesame butter is rated high due to its amazing properties. It&rsquo;s not as highly processed and refined as its counterpart, peanut butter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These power balls also include raw cashews and chia seeds which are both an amazing source of protein and energy. These power balls can be made in a larger batch, placed in the freezer and stored for up to two months in an airtight container. These are the perfect on the go snack.</p>\r\n",

I just can&rsquo;t resist a crunchy snack paired with infinite options to dip it in! My favorite is hummus and pita chips.

Cannellini beans definitely have a more subtle flavor and can hold nicely to bolder flavors such as Kalamata olives and roasted red peppers. By keeping your mix-ins chunky, you are adding additional texture while also bulking up the dip. The best part about this is that it&rsquo;s totally customizable! Try other mix-ins such as pine nuts, basil, and sundried tomatoes. Just remember to keep it simple and of course, flavorful!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dip comes together in about 5 minutes, which makes it the perfect last minute entertaining food and also makes it the perfect make-ahead-and-store-in-the-fridge for a quick snack fix later.

The smokiness from the chipotle and paprika are perfect in replacing that meat flavor, making this vegan version certain to win over sworn-carnivores.

This zoodle pasta Pomodoro with hemp parmesan puts a new twist on the traditional flavors of Italy!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe is a twist from the traditional pasta favored by most Italian food lovers. Instead of the glutinous noodles traditionally used in pasta dishes, this recipe uses two types of noodles: zucchini and shirataki, also known as konjac or miracle noodles. If you have not tried shirataki noodles, you are definitely missing out. These translucent noodles have zero calories, are high in fiber and very filling. They are made from glucomannan, a type of fiber that comes from the root of the konjac plant. Since they are high in fiber, they digest slowly, and you feel fuller longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Mary%20Luciano%20-%20Zoodle%20Pasta%20%20Photo8_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, zucchini has a boost of nutrient value and is a healthier alternative to noodles. They contain potassium, folate, magnesium, and have a good source of vitamin A and C. They are low in calories with a high water content, which make them an excellent choice if you want to shed a few pounds and ditch the starchy carbs. So give this recipe a whirl.

These banana flour brownies are the answer!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Brownies may not be the traditional health food, but you can switch out unhealthy ingredients and replace them with whole foods. A little treat here and there is great, not only for your body, but also for your brain. Allowing yourself to have a healthy treat once or twice a week can help reduce sugar cravings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/banana%20flour%20brownies_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quest for healthy brownies is always on my radar. Countless hours have been spent in the kitchen trying to formulate a delicious and healthy recipe that is gluten free, nutritious, and tasty! I stumbled across banana flour at my local health food store and was intrigued to try it. The result was excellent, and these brownies were a knockout. After a few hit and misses, I developed a delicious and chocolate filled brownie that will leave you wanting seconds. The ingredients in these brownies are pure and simple. This recipe uses chocolate which contains antioxidants which can help your body stave off diseases and help to clear out free radicals in the body. If you have an allergy to chocolate, you can always swap it out for carob powder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banana flour is made of green bananas which have a high starch content so you can cut back on the amount of flour in a given recipe. When blended with other ingredients, the flour has a very neutral taste. Banana flour is unlike any other flour as it boasts a high potassium content and rich in minerals and vitamins. Unlike the delicious yellow ripe banana&rsquo;s we have all grown to love, green bananas are lower in sugar. Green bananas also have resistance starch. What that means is that it passes through your intestine unchanged. It is converted into an insoluble fiber which can help constipation. Overall green bananas are amazing for controlling blood sugar and managing weight.</p>\r\n",

The best part about this salad is that the longer it marinates, the better it tastes. By using fresh ingredients, this makes a great main meal, salad or salsa for any occasion. One of my favorite things about this salad is that it doesn&rsquo;t contain any oil.

This recipe calls for a lot of chopping and dicing so make sure that knife is sharp. This recipe calls for chopped cilantro, parsley, and pepper. To give this recipe a kick of healthy fats, it uses creamy and ripe avocado. Avocados are one of the world&#39;s most incredible and nutrient dense foods. Avocados contain more potassium than bananas. They are also loaded with fiber which can help regulate appetite and maintain a healthy digestive tract. Most people are concerned with avocado&rsquo;s high-fat content and weight gain. Although avocados are high in fat, by eating and incorporating avocados into your daily meals it will keep you more satiated which will, therefore, reduce your desire to overeat later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(<strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>If you&#39;re struggling to find ways to add avocados and&nbsp;healthy fats to your diet, <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/healthhub/25-best-uses-avocados\" target=\"_blank\">check out our 25 best ways to add avocad</a><a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/healthhub/25-best-uses-avocados\">o.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can always add any additional beans, legumes, and vegetables to this salad.

Grilled pizza is perfect for those hot summer nights that are coming soon.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Grilled pizza is a fun way to make dinner. Who wants to heat up the house when it&#39;s already hot outside? Let the heat stay outside. Fire up your grill and enjoy a delicious comfort food!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/TomatoPizza-02_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pizza is so versatile. Basically, you can add any ingredients that your heart desires. Empty out your fridge and use up all your leftovers. Peppers, mushrooms, artichokes, squash, BBQ sauce, and Alfredo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When cooking a pizza on a grill, it can be tricky. But don&rsquo;t be intimidated. Warm the grill up well before cooking anything. Once the dough is rolled out very evenly, cook one side until it is a light golden brown. This can happen very quickly if you aren&rsquo;t paying attention. My pizza has gone from almost done to burned in just a matter of moments on several occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This particular pizza recipe is favorite when we have a plethora of tomatoes during harvest season. Fresh basil is delicious, but you can use dried in a pinch. Tomatoes are high in fiber and a good source of vitamin A, C, B2, folate, and chromium. Not only does basil add exquisite flavor, but it is also loaded with vitamins A and K. The whole wheat crust adds essential fiber and has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease. It also is high B vitamins, and vitamin E.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time to get grilling!</p>\r\n",

This couscous salad with its Middle Eastern flare means the search is over.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Salads are best when they are bursting with different textures, crunches, and freshness. This salad is vibrant and without a trace of guilt in it! This pretty salad is super easy to make, delicious to eat, and gorgeous to look at. This salad is filled with herbs, vegetables, and spices. We use a delicious tarragon dressing for extra flavor. You can always omit the tarragon for any herb of choice such as basil or parsley. With this salad, you can add any additional fruits, vegetables, or spices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/couscous%20salad_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what exactly is pearl couscous? Pearl couscous is also called Israeli couscous. It is made out of semolina or wheat and typically doesn&rsquo;t have much flavor. Before you boil the couscous, you can slightly toast the couscous in a pan to give a beautiful nuttiness to the grain. It is similar to small balls of pasta. Since this ingredient is so versatile, it will work well with any dish. When you cook it with a delicious vegetable stock and herbs, it adds a great flavor profile to it. Although not a gluten-free grain, it is low on the glycemic index making it healthy and rich in fiber. Couscous is also rich in vitamins and minerals such as calcium, protein, and selenium. Couscous at times may be difficult to find. You can always check your local Middle Eastern supermarket or Middle Eastern section in your grocery store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This couscous salad is perfect as a dinner or lunch the following day. Toss it in an airtight container or a mason jar and voila! The longer the herbs and dressing soak into the couscous, the tastier it gets. You can add some chopped nuts, seeds, or lettuce greens to add different flavors and textures.</p>\r\n",

It has many vitamins and minerals including potassium. Potassium is important for maintaining nerve function and healthy blood pressure levels. This fruit is also linked to antioxidants and bioflavonoids that researchers believe could lower the likelihood of cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong>: There are two main lime fruits: Tahitian and Key. Did you know that Key Lime Pie was originated in Key West in the 1800&rsquo;s? It has been around awhile, and I don&rsquo;t think it is going anywhere!</p>\r\n",

These spicy and crunchy vegetables can help our digestion break down toxins in the body. Radishes have a very high amount of vitamin C that helps our immune system stay strong and healthy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri,sans-serif\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/cucumber%20radish%20salad_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri,sans-serif\">When you pair radishes with cucumbers, you have a hydration powerhouse. Both of these vegetables have high water content that keeps your body hydrated and nourished all season long.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri,sans-serif\">The real star in this recipe is the hemp heart dressing. Hemp hearts are a great nutrition boost. Hemp hearts have a natural nutty flavor which adds an incredible taste to dishes or salad dressing. Hemp hearts are rich in Omega-3 and Omega-6 which helps maintain a healthy body and brain function. Our body does not produce them, so we need to get them from food sources. Hemp hearts are rich in plant-based protein, so they are a great way for vegans or vegetarians to amass a large amount of protein. A few tablespoons of hemp hearts have over 11 grams of protein which is comparable to a steak. Hemp hearts are easy to digest so your body doesn&rsquo;t need to go into overdrive trying to digest them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri,sans-serif\">This salad will keep up to four days in an airtight container in the fridge.</span></p>\r\n",

Did you know some 99 cent stores and dollar stores carry fresh produce? High-end grocery stores often reject food that is too ugly to display, like bananas that are too curvy or too short, apples that aren&rsquo;t quite as red, or celery that is too green. Discount stores snatch these up. Same quality food at lower prices. They also buy regular produce in season. There are even organic options. We may have made this too easy on the Vegan Vigilante.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason easily bags fresh tomatoes, garlic, avocado, spaghetti squash, asparagus, bell peppers, and so much more.

You can even put this into your water bottle for when you are on the go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Learn What to Avoid and how to Change Things Up!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Colors</em>: from sports drinks, juices &ndash; they are full of artificial dyes and other preservatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, choose a drink that is 100% natural from fruit, or use your own fruit purees! Raspberries, strawberries, and beets &ndash; make incredible ruby red drinks that are amazing for the playing field!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fizzy Beverages Such as Sodas:</em> not only are they filled with calories and syrups, but they can actually dehydrate you</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead choose filtered, flat or spring water instead and add in mint or ginger for something refreshing and different. You can even opt for homemade kombucha or water kefir and flavor these your own way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Added Sugars:</em> (such as glucose, fructose, corn syrup), which just means added empty calories!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead choose natural sweeteners if necessary such as honey, maple syrup or from fruit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cream or Milk-Based Beverages:</em> loaded with poor quality fat and often lots of sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, if you are feeling like something thick and creamy, make a smoothie or have one made with pure ingredients by using coconut milk, almond milk or hempseed milk. Any latte can be made with these instead and taste even more delicious!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is my favorite summer beverage. I keep this in pitchers in the fridge all summer long!

Because sometimes you&rsquo;ve gotta ice the sunshine!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe was inspired from the many lemons that I have juiced with my awesome citrus juicer. I typically buy a bunch of lemons and juice them once a week so that I always have lemon juice whenever I need it. My favorite thing to do after extracting the juice is to fill up my stainless steel ice cube tray and freeze it to make lemon ice cubes. Once the cubes are frozen, I pop them out, place them in a zip lock bag and voila, lemon ice cubes whenever I need them. I can pop one in my water in the morning which is great for cleaning the liver first thing. I can add them to my green juice for a little bit of zing. And let&rsquo;s not forget, lemons are also great for salad dressings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Mary%20Luciano-Photo%201-Refreshing%20Lemon%20Cups_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am always so amazed at how wonderful the juicer extracts juice from lemons. The lemon shells look so perfectly clean inside. This time I wasn&rsquo;t ready to throw the shells into the compost. I decided that I was going to use them as a dessert cup instead. There are many creative ways to use lemon cups: from lemon puddings to sorbets, what a great way to impress guests. Below is another creative recipe using lemons and lemon cups.

Using only simple and whole ingredients combining raw nuts, unsweetened coconut, and organic jam, this recipe comes together in no time. We used organic jam, but as the spring season rolls around, you could use your own homemade jam to really add a special touch to these bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only is this recipe delicious, but it is also nutritionally superior to any store bought bar you will buy. Walnuts and almonds have incredible health benefits which boost from being antioxidants, high in omega 3-6, container fiber and protein. The real winner in this bar is the coconut. Coconut is one of the most nutrient dense foods on this planet. This beautiful tropical fruit can provide you with enough energy to power you through an entire day. Coconut is super high in electrolytes, iron, and fats which all add to a well-balanced diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Place these bars in the fridge after they have cooled in an airtight container. They will last up to five days (if they last that long!). You can top these bars with a variety of jams if you aren&rsquo;t fond of strawberry. A great alternative would be to use apricot jam which is a milder flavor. If there is a peanut allergy, you can substitute almonds on top. Do a little dance and peanut butter jelly time into spring!

The problem is that so many recipes contain ingredients that leave you feeling bloated and heavy. Muffins are one of my favorite things to eat, and it&rsquo;s often hard for me to walk by these delicious pastries without wanting to devour them. But then I remember how they are made - full of dairy with cups of sugar and gluten added &ndash; and suddenly one of my favorite treats is a major turn-off. That&rsquo;s why I experimented in the kitchen and found a recipe that achieves that same, delicious, flavorful taste of a muffin while also containing healthy, natural ingredients.

You&rsquo;re welcome!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Summer weather is here, and hot soups are out the door. Make way for delicious chilled soups which will leave you feeling energized and light throughout the day. Fresh sweet corn is in season so why not use this beautiful plant to make a delicious vegan corn chowder recipe. We use coconut milk to replace the cream and jalape&ntilde;os to give it an extra kick. Some people find that coconut milk will change the flavor of the recipe so you can always add organic soy milk or almond milk if you prefer a more neutral taste. This recipe is gluten free, dairy free, vegan, and 100 percent healthy! This was a fan favorite at a potluck I recently attended. Everyone was shocked that this recipe was so silky and smooth even without using cream. This recipe is definitely a crowd pleaser. You can add more jalape&ntilde;os to give it that extra notch of heat or tone it down to make a more subdued and silky soup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/corn%20chowder_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spring and summer time are the best times for fruits and vegetables so why not maximize their delicious flavors and textures. The first harvest of corn has arrived, and it&rsquo;s unbelievably sweet. Adding chopped peppers, potatoes, and greens makes this soup super hearty. This is a great recipe to make in large quantities. You can divide them into small containers and freeze them. All you need to do is thaw it out and voila, the perfect lunch or quick dinner. You can eat this cold, or you can have it hot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years corn has gotten a bad reputation from being genetically modified and high in carbohydrates. The truth is that if you can get it from your local farmer, it is a great source of nutrients such as vitamin b and selenium which is hard to find in foods. You can add any additional vegetables to add extra nutrients such as cauliflower, sweet potatoes or any greens that are in season.</p>\r\n",

J-Wro must tackle 7-11 this time. That&rsquo;s right, all his ingredients for a plant-based, healthy, delicious meal must come from the home of the Slurpee and Big Gulp, the convenience store on the corner you hit at the beginning of road trips, the snack shop that comes to mind when cravings strike in the middle of the night.

We sure didn&rsquo;t, or we might have made this harder on the Vegan Vigilante.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coconut water, organic bars, nuts, seeds, and fresh fruits like mango, banana, kiwi, and strawberries! Jason walks out with plenty of ingredients for one monster smoothie bowl extraordinaire. He makes his own almond milk from raw almonds found in the aisles, adds his fruits, and blends away. He tops it with vegan bars and cookies. Can you say &ldquo;yum?&rdquo; This recipe easily goes spoon to spoon with any fancy smoothie bowl using ingredients from a health food store. Maybe we need to make things even harder on our superhero next week.</p>\r\n",

Most often our plates did not have any green food on them unless you counted the green icing on the birthday cake or the occasional green bean casserole. That being said, when I first started really changing my lifestyle and fixing my diet, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how my family would respond. Would they judge me, or think I am judging them and their meal choices? Would this be an unnecessary cause of stress? Would it be better to make up an excuse not to go to avoid being around the tempting food that wouldn&rsquo;t make me feel very good?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Purple%20Cabbage_Cabbage_ISS_12692_13836_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say, I found that it wasn&rsquo;t as hard to eat healthy at gatherings if I prepared correctly.

I made it clear that it wasn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t like their food or appreciate them, but some foods just physically made me feel really sick. That is why I have to avoid the processed oils, white sugar, or dairy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prepare a healthy main meal dish to bring that you can be full on, just in case this is the only thing you can eat. A big salad is a great idea!

I have found that the best way to turn my family&rsquo;s health around was not by lecturing them on the dangers of processed foods, dairy, and conventionally processed meats, but in leading by example! And letting them see my own health turnaround, and seeing that my food actually tastes GOOD! They were hesitant at first, but then they started asking questions, being receptive, and are changing their lifestyles to become healthier and happier with increased stamina and less fatigue!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the perfect take along to your summer barbecue!</p>\r\n",

		"articleBodyHTML" : "<h2>Ever starved in an airport? Or worse, in a plane? Starve no more! Follow these 8&nbsp;tips for the traveling vegan foodie!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is nothing worse than being stranded without food in an airport (okay, there are a lot of things that are worse, but being stuck at the airport with no food isn&rsquo;t awesome.). Sometimes you have to be creative and make do with limited resources. It is so important to make sure you are nourished when you are away. That may mean that you have to pack yourself a whole bunch of goodies to take with you on the go, just in case. Even if your airport may accommodate you with food stalls, it is not worth going through the stress that you may not be eating for the next few hours. Don&rsquo;t resort to white sugar, white flour, or fried foods; all of these can zap your energy and your immune system while thousands of feet in the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/chocolate_Dark_Cinnamon_ISS_5130_02076_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you choose not to bring your own food for when you get to your destination, then it is important to make use of the internet and source out some of the healthy, vegetarian and organic restaurants and stores that may be nearby. It is imperative that you put your eating habits first when you travel. The last thing you want is to be left hungry, tired, and frustrated because you didn&rsquo;t plan properly!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scope out the scene before you fly and check online resources regarding the area where you&rsquo;re traveling. You&rsquo;ll want to find local restaurants, health food stores, and farmers markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Always remember quick grab goodies like fresh fruit, raw veggies and other whole foods like avocado and coconut chips. You also need to definitely make and bring a trail mix with you every time you travel (see recipe below). These are great for both the plane and to keep in your bag while traveling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quick-fix breakfasts are cured with chia seeds and buckwheat. You can make them anywhere! All you need is some added water or nut milk (you may want to bring some cinnamon and powdered stevia too!). If you have a morning flight, this is perfect, too, while on the plane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bring an organic dark chocolate. The healthy fat will keep you full, and the chocolate will keep you happy even if your fellow passengers aren&rsquo;t always pleasant. Plus, it will remove the temptation to get a mini, overpriced bag of junk food on the plane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(NOTE: If you&#39;re looking for a little pick me up and want to stay away from the energy drink, check out our article on the plant based foods to boost your energy. <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/healthhub/boost-energy-plant-based-foods?utm_source=healthhub&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=article_ad\">Click here.</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pack more food than you think you will need. Don&rsquo;t just fill a single container with snacks bring two or more. You never know what can happen! If your flight is delayed a few hours, or there&rsquo;s no chance of a healthy restaurant in sight, you&rsquo;ll be grateful you have extra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/dried%20fruits_fruit_ISS_9650_24376_ARTICLE.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:200px\" />Pack organic dried fruit like mango, apple, and pear slices (organic is especially important for dried fruit to make sure you skip the preservatives or extra sugar). The tendency for people in airports is to grab a bag of candy. Your dried fruit will save you the sugar, calories, colors, and blood sugar crash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get savory with snacks like roasted pumpkin seeds with sea salt or seaweed. You can even bring an avocado with sea salt. This can help curb your sweet cravings and keep your salty tooth happy, so you don&rsquo;t have to give into chips or pretzels on the plane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hydrate! Especially when you are going up in the air the body loses so much water, and planes tend to be extremely dry. Obviously, you will have buy water or other liquids on &ldquo;the other side,&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t forget and drink lots before, during, and after your flight. I like to also add chlorophyll or <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/ormus-supergreens-mint-8oz\">Sunwarrior Super Greens</a> to my water to help counter the effects of the radiation in flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make this delicious trail mix combination in large batches to snack on even when you&rsquo;re not traveling!</p>\r\n",

Hence it is also marketed as an aphrodisiac. It is also known to improve blood circulation, improve energy levels, increase immunity level and can be used as a replacement for cacao if one is allergic to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cacao Powder</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cacao powder is one of the most important ingredients in chocolate. Cacao powder which is the raw powdered form obtained from cocoa beans is not the same as cocoa powder, which is a processed form with added sugar and chemicals. Cacao powder is rich in antioxidants, magnesium, iron, calcium and it is known to cure mood swings, improve energy levels, reduce muscle cramps, prevents pre-mature aging and helps to improve cardiovascular function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sea Salt</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sea salt, unlike regular salt, is not iodized and hence contains only traces of iodine. But, Sea salt is packed with about 72 minerals; it helps to get rid of mucous, it improves hair and skin quality, it helps you to lose those extra pounds, it helps to facilitate the functioning of muscle fibers and move all it brings out the aroma and taste in any recipe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat right.

What exactly are micro greens you ask? You&rsquo;ve probably seen them covering dishes in restaurants which make them so appealing and stunning visually. These little guys aren&rsquo;t only gorgeous, they pack a nutritional punch! Micro greens absorb nutrients in the soil which gives them a boost of nutritional value. Micro greens are typically grown in greenhouses and can be found anywhere in the world. The carbon footprint of these plants are very low, so it&rsquo;s a perfect farm to table green. Micro greens are lighter in flavor than their mature counterparts. They take on different textures and flavors, ranging from sweet to spicy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real star of this salad is the delicious fennel. This vegetable has fantastic health benefits including large amounts of vitamin C which can help boost your immune system. Fennel has been known to help facilitate digestion, therefore, processing food more readily in the body. Fennel is high in fiber which can aid processing waste in the stomach. The most surprising fact about fennel is that it is a natural source of electrolytes. Fennel is immensely high in potassium which our body craves post workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This homemade salad will leave you smiling ear to ear.

Recovery can happen for you in a natural and healthy way.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Recovery plays an important role in an active person&rsquo;s life. If you are a heavy weight lifter or a long distance runner or even a yoga practitioner, pain is your friend. &ldquo;No pain, no gain&rdquo; mantra works like a charm when one is active. Your body going through inflammation and soreness after a strenuous exercise is considered healthy as that is the only way you realize that your muscles are building and getting stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/man_woman_workout_exercise_gym_ING_32193_139511_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While working out continuously and getting stronger is great, some resort to painkillers in order to cope up with workouts .Commonly used painkillers such as Ibuprofen are known to reduce inflammatory pain which helps people go harder on their workout and helps them recover faster. However, using painkillers for recovery can, in the long run, affect kidney and liver function as they tend to block biochemicals such as prostaglandins. Instead of taking pain killers, here are some natural ways to beat inflammation and soreness so you can recover in a healthy way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ice Baths</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ice baths have been used since ancient times to build a stronger immune system and for beauty purposes. Sitting in an ice bath after a workout can drastically relax your muscles by reducing inflammation, closing those open pores, and by cooling off your system .This is not just great for your muscles but excellent for your skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sleep</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing screams recovery louder than a good night&rsquo;s rest. Your body recovers at its highest rate when you are sleeping. It&rsquo;s the time to give your muscles and organs a good break and helps get rid of lactic acid and aids in muscle recovery. Six to eight hours are generally recommended. If you are physically active for more than two hours a day, you should extend your sleep to ten hours a night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/massage_woman_rose_petals_ARTICLE.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:200px\" />Massage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being physically active has great benefits but can simultaneously cause havoc on your body when you have pushed it over a certain point. Massages are a great way to relax your mind and body. Massage relieves lactic acid, remove knots in your body, improves blood circulation, and helps with mental relaxation. Getting a massage once a week is ideal if you are strenuously active.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nutritious Diet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The healthier you eat, the faster you recover. It&rsquo;s that simple. Focus on eating wholesome and organic foods and sources of carbohydrates and protein that come from places other than red meat and peanut butter. Focus on quinoa, almond butter, lentils, and loads of greens to support your active lifestyle and speedy recovery. <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/wb-choco-sm\" target=\"_blank\">Sunwarrior</a> has some great protein powders that are organic and fabulous tasting to help you with your post work out nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 100%;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">Find the Meal Plan That Works For You</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Join Sunwarrior&rsquo;s Fitness Challenge and get access to personalized meal plans that can help you support your healthy lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/fitness-challenge?utm_source=healthhub&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=article_ad\">Join Today!</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

There are even non-raw, non-vegetarian twists with such inclusions as bread, seafood, meat stock, boiled egg, roasted tomatoes, and wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with ingredients, texture&mdash;how thick the gazpacho is made&mdash;varies by family and by regions of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re opting for the more timeless style of gazpacho, know that every batch you make will taste different. Your selection of tomato will have a big bearing on the outcome, of course. The best tomatoes make the best gazpacho, so use fresh, juicy, organic heirloom tomatoes if you have access to them. Letting gazpacho &ldquo;sit&rdquo; allows the flavors to develop, but to reap the most nutritional benefits from this summer favorite, eat it soon after preparing&mdash;perhaps within a day or two.

Corn on the cob is a great way to get started with this corn and zucchini basil salad.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s always a good idea to think about what seasonal veggies will be available. Summer boasts a ton of awesome veggies; corn is my favorite! I love corn on the cob whether it&rsquo;s boiled and covered in lime and sea salt, grilled and topped with cilantro, or just plain ol&rsquo; by itself. The sweet kernels are so addicting that it&rsquo;s hard for me to eat just one ear! If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;re going to be looking for ways to incorporate corn into your diet in these hot summer months, and this zucchini and corn salad is perfect! Packed with veggies and full of simple flavors, this salad is great to take to a potluck or even just have in the fridge for when you need some wholesome veggie goodness. This dish comes together in about 10 minutes so you know you can have a healthy side in no time at all. Try grilling the corn if you want a charred flavor, or try adding other veggies like yellow squash or cucumbers for extra crunch!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/corn%20squash%20salad%201_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n",

Yep, Egyptians depicted watermelon in their drawings on the walls of tombs and even left watermelon with their dead to nourish them as they journeyed through the underworld. Because watermelons are native to Africa, they need hot, sunny conditions to thrive. Some varieties need up to 130 warm days to ripen. Most watermelons mature in 85 to 100 days. We think of watermelon as a fruit because of its sweet flavor, but watermelon is actually a vegetable. It belongs to the cucurbit family and is related to pumpkins, cucumbers, and squash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay hydrated.</p>\r\n",

Add kale first, covering most of the rice paper except at the ends. Leave some room at the ends so you can roll it and it sticks. Start adding your veggies inside one by one. Don&rsquo;t add too much or the bite will be too big. After you put the desired veggies in roll, lift the side of the rice paper that&#39;s closest to you, gently pull it forward (away from you) over the fillings. Hold the wrap firmly while you fold in each end of the wrap. Continue rolling to seal the seam. After it looks like a burrito, let it set for a bit. Continue to make the rest until you have made the entire batch of veggie rolls. Cut into bite size pieces so you can dip into hummus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fun fact about rice paper:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that Xuancheng is the place where rice paper originally came from? The name of the paper was mentioned in many historical accounts from as early as the 8th century. Like tortillas in Mexico, rice papers are the all-purpose food wrappers of Asia. They are made by combining finely ground rice, water, salt, and sometimes tapioca flour, then rolling out the mixture into paper-thin rounds and drying the rounds on bamboo mats in the sun. When dry the rounds look glassy and brittle, the crosshatch patterns from the bamboo showing through. When wet, they are translucent and pleasantly chewy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy Dipping!</p>\r\n",

Here is where dressing gets real!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I grew up in Upstate New York, and in the summertime, we would take weekend family road trips to explore the area. One summer, we visited the Thousand Islands Region, located along the upper St. Lawrence River, between the United States and Canada. It seemed that everywhere we stopped, and no matter what we ordered to eat, it came with a different variation of a condiment called Thousand Island dressing. If you like pink/orange salad dressings such as French or Russian&mdash;and maybe even if you don&rsquo;t&mdash;you&rsquo;ll enjoy Thousand Island. While other dressings are typically smooth, this one is characterized by a chunky texture, the result of stirring chopped pickles into the final sauce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Thousand%20island_dressing_salad_ISS_8533_06437_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional Thousand Island is made from a mayonnaise base and ketchup; it may also include Worcestershire sauce. With its popularity no longer confined to Upstate New York, regional variations of the dressing abound. Besides pickles or pickle relish, the classic version may also contain minced garlic, chives, pimento, parsley, olives, red pepper, onion, or a hard-boiled egg. I wanted to create a vegan Thousand Island, and I personally like the clean flavor of using only one &ldquo;chunky&rdquo; addition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever you add to your rendition of this recipe, you&rsquo;ll likely think it has a &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; taste. This may be because Thousand Island Dressing, or some version of it, is often the &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; used by restaurants.</p>\r\n",

Breakfast on the go doesn&rsquo;t have to look like that mundane bowl of oatmeal. This papaya boat takes all of two minutes to make. You can store the other half in the fridge for the following morning, and it will be as fresh as when you cut it. We used coconut yogurt in the center of this papaya boat, but you can use any nondairy yogurt of choice.

The best part about eating papaya first thing in the morning is that it contains a digestive enzyme called papain along with fiber which will leave your stomach in tip top shape. As well as being great for digestive problems, papayas are packed with vitamins and minerals. Papaya, although a tropical fruit, is relatively low in sugar and is low calorie. We used coconut yogurt in this recipe, but you can also use a variety of nondairy yogurts such as soy or almond yogurt. This can be found in the health food isle at your local supermarket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Papaya boats are so much fun to make because you can choose an assortment of toppings that you like. I try to use whatever is fresh and in season to maximize the nutrients that I&rsquo;m consuming. You can add granola, nuts, seeds, and fruit. You can even swap out the yogurt for nondairy sorbet and make a delicious dessert on hot days. Make your papaya your own Picasso and paint a beautiful masterpiece of fruits!</p>\r\n",

Use the big spoon.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you visit the grocery store, you typically notice two types of watermelon: seeded and seedless. But did you know there are over 1200 varieties grown throughout the world? That&rsquo;s a lotta melon! The selections are nearly endless: seeded or seedless, three-pound mini melons up to record-breaking 250-pounders, red, yellow, pink, orange. With any of these options, you also get some pretty great benefits&mdash;watermelons are about 92% water (think hydration!), contain the antioxidant lycopene (which may boost your sun-screening power), and they&rsquo;re cholesterol-free, fat-free, and sodium-free. No matter which type you&rsquo;re eating, one thing is common to all of them: their sweet, thirst-quenching meat is perfect for summertime and early fall enjoyment. My chilled soup combines the melon with sweet wine, grapes, raisins and a mint topper&mdash;summertime 2.0!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/JL%20WMelon%20in%20garden%20above2_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe calls for seedless, ruby red watermelon&mdash;but feel free to experiment! Just note that different cultivars will alter the taste. I don&rsquo;t recommend changing up the seedless part, though; it&rsquo;s best to avoid the bitterness that results after seeds are pureed by the blender. (If you must buy seeded melon, my recommendation would be to remove those kernels before whipping up your soup.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To amp up the natural sweetness of the melon, we&rsquo;re using a couple of sweeteners: sweet wine and coconut nectar. If you choose not to use wine, try substituting kombucha instead or white grape juice. You may also choose to substitute agave nectar or something similar for the coconut nectar if you want, but don&rsquo;t stray too far&mdash;use of maple syrup, honey, or a similar sweetener would change the flavor of the dish significantly and is not recommended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember to add your mint last, so it doesn&rsquo;t infuse too long and overshadow the delicate watermelon flavor in the soup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One last tip: Watermelon Soup is best consumed the same day it&rsquo;s made.</p>\r\n",

It is the cheapest and quickest way to make a meal for a large group or for multiple personal servings over and over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, don&rsquo;t get caught up with ingredients or quantities. Just get creative and have fun with new items (like squash instead of white potatoes) and try planning with different amounts, add a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon if it&rsquo;s an herb that you really like!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, soups freeze really well.

Cashew, coconut, chocolate cookies are everything tasty and awesome!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a gluten-free baker, I incorporate almond butter into many recipes. It&rsquo;s a reliable flour alternative, and it helps bind all the ingredients together. While almond butter will always be my go-to choice (mostly because I&rsquo;m obsessed with the taste), I decided to experiment with cashew butter for my new cookie recipe. Cashew butter is creamy, buttery, and extremely smooth. I usually shy away from peanut butter because it is often processed, double the amount of sugar, and loaded with calories and fats. It&rsquo;s really a no-brainer to use cashew butter when straying from almond. The beauty of this recipe is that as long as you create the cashew butter base, you can add any ingredient into the batter to form your perfect cookie.

This beautiful marriage between these three ingredients makes a tantalizing and delicious chia seed pudding that will keep your energized all the way to lunch. Peanuts are packed with fiber, protein, and healthy fats which can curb hunger later on during the day. You can also add cocoa powder to your nut milk and create a chocolate chia pudding and top it with nuts.

		"articleBodyHTML" : "<h2>Breathe some happiness into your dinner with a side dish that sings: Broccoli Raisin Salad! Trust us; it&rsquo;s nothing like the stuff grandma brought to family parties.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing beats the satisfying crunch of a bite of broccoli. For this salad, you can take extra pleasure in the fact that we&rsquo;re removing the &ldquo;uglies&rdquo; from the traditional broccoli-and-raisin salad: no mayo, sugar, or bacon. For sweetness, we&rsquo;re relying on the natural sugars in the raisins&mdash;including the water used to soak them&mdash;and adding just a dab of maple syrup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/broccoli_raisin_salad_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another unconventional twist in this recipe is the added zing of mustard and lemon juice, which act as more flavorful replacements for the vinegar. Feel free to experiment and add more mustard if you want to bump up the tanginess!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know nutrients are condensed when a food is dried or dehydrated? Once grapes transform into raisins, their nutrients become concentrated, so even a handful of raisins is chock full of B vitamins, iron, and potassium. Additionally, snacking or including raisins in a salad like this one is a great way to sneak good carbohydrates for energy into the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike other broccoli and raisin salad mixes, which may contain dairy or meat, this one is vegan. For a decorative sprinkle and extra crunch, hold the sunflower seeds until the end for a topping instead of blending with the rest. Want to ramp up the nutrition even more? Sprout the sunflower seeds for a day before adding them to the salad.</p>\r\n",

Pumpkin-flavored foods have become quite the trend, but they can also be dangerous.

This food is also packed with Vitamin C, which, of course, helps maintain a healthy immune system. So how do you enjoy the benefits of this fall favorite without adding unhealthy ingredients? Here is a delicious, fluffy pumpkin-chocolate chip cookie recipe that will satisfy any cookie craving.

Their talent is keeping you going all morning long. The thing is: I&rsquo;m only talking about overnight oats on their own.

Let the flapjack fabulousness begin!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin spice, and chai are all autumn favorites. Using spices that reflect upon a season can bring back happy memories linked with food. For this recipe, we decided to use cinnamon, nutmeg, and apple. Your kitchen will smell out of this world from all the aromas and spices in the air. Let&rsquo;s kick off this season with some delicious flapjacks that are protein-packed and gluten-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/apple_pancakes_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe uses gluten-free flour, but you can opt for regular flour or even buckwheat flour. Buckwheat flour will give a delicious nutty and dense flavor to the pancakes. These pancakes are heaven on a plate. They are thick, light and fluffy. The best types of pancakes are ones that fluff up to double their size. They are less dense and make an overall better pancake. This recipe comes together in no time. It takes all of five minutes to whip up and less than 10 minutes to cook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To give an extra crunch to these pancakes, this recipe used freeze-dried apples. You can always opt to use fresh apples as it is the season to do so! We suggest using a Granny Smith apple. Simply dice up your apple, sprinkle some cinnamon, nutmeg, and a touch of coconut sugar, and you have the best apple topping in the world. The final and most important part of this recipe is to drizzle your maple syrup on top. Maple syrup is one of Nature&rsquo;s wonders. Not only is maple syrup pure and contains no high fructose corn syrup, but it also boosts an incredible amount of nutrients such as calcium, potassium, and sodium.</p>\r\n",

I even added some of my leftovers to almond milk yogurt the following morning! You can also incorporate other varieties of root or winter veggies to the 1.5 lbs. directed. Some great additions or substitutes include sweet potatoes, pumpkin, acorn squash, parsnips, turnip, carrots, and beets. I have also made this recipe with a sweet potatoes mix, including Japanese sweet potatoes, Hannah sweet potatoes, Purple sweet potatoes, and Jewel sweet potatoes. Root vegetables are a great way to satisfy your &ldquo;comfort food&rdquo; cravings in the fall and winter months without having to feel guilty! Squash and other root veggies are great complex carbs with a variety of vitamins, and fiber to keep you full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/butternut_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n",

In my opinion, the flavors of the season don&rsquo;t last long enough. One of my favorite morning treats to enjoy while sipping my green tea is a delicious muffin. The problem is, what&rsquo;s available in most stores doesn&rsquo;t meet my health requirements. I avoid dairy, gluten, and excess sugar which are three ingredients people often make muffins with. I discovered a recipe for flourless, vegan pumpkin spice muffins that will leave you wondering why those three ingredients would ever be needed again to satisfy your next muffin craving. The centers are moist, the base has just the right amount of crisp, and the pumpkin flavor mixed with the chocolate melts in your mouth. If you are planning a celebration and want to make these really festive, use the muffins as your cake and frost them however you please to make healthy cupcakes.

Press the crust evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch, parchment lined, springform pan to about &frac14; inch thickness. Set aside while you make the filling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. In a high-speed blender, blend together cashews, agave or maple syrup and the lemon juice until creamy and smooth, scraping down the sides occasionally if necessary. Add the coconut oil, vanilla, and sea salt and continue to blend until mixture is well combined. The consistency will be similar to a thick pudding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Use a spatula and pour 2/3rds of the filling on top of the crust and smooth evenly, cover the pan with a lid or plastic and place in the freezer on a flat surface for approximately 2 hours or until semi-frozen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. With the remaining cashew blend, add the blueberries and blueberry powder if using and blend until smooth and creamy. Set aside until the first layer of the cheesecake is firm enough to let the blueberry layer stay on top.&nbsp; At that time carefully pour or spoon over and smooth evenly. Cover the cheesecake and place in the freezer on a flat surface for an additional 2 hours or until frozen throughout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp; When ready to serve, remove the cheesecake from the pan and let stand at room temp for 5-10 mins then garnish as desired and slice into 12 pieces.&nbsp; Return any leftovers to the freezer or fridge until you are ready to enjoy again.&nbsp; This delish cake will keep up 2-4 weeks if well wrapped.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Blueberry Compote</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cook the berries and cinnamon over medium heat in a small saucepan until boiling, reduce heat to simmer and continue to cook until the berries are thickened to coat the back of a spoon.

These Thanksgiving pecan paleo bars definitely make the grateful-for-good-food list!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Baking can be the most rewarding accomplishment. After the fruits of your labor, you are left with a delicious masterpiece that should be eaten slowly and with love. It&rsquo;s even better if the fruits of your labor are healthy and guilt-free. One of the best times of the year for baking and cooking is fall. Delicious flavors are upon us such as cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pecan pies! Pecan pie in my eyes is what dreams are made of. Rich, delicious and completely irresistible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/pecan%20pie%20bar_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanksgiving is a time of year where we think of all of the things we are thankful for, family coming together and time spent cooking together as a unit. This recipe for pecan pie bars uses natural ingredients such as maple syrup, almond flour, and coconut flour. Coconut flour has grown in popularity over the years. As more and more people are becoming gluten intolerant, coconut flour has been a go-to. Unlike most flours which are low in nutrients, coconut flour is high in protein, healthy fats, and has a low glycemic index. It is also made of digestible carbohydrates making this flour easy for your stomach to digest and process. Coconut flour is also high in fiber which helps promote a healthy digestive tract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe is incredible with a salted caramel sauce that uses pitted dates, almond butter, coconut oil, and Himalayan salt. All you need to do place all of those ingredients into a high-speed blender, pour on top of your pecan bars and voila, the most decadent and guilt-free treats you will have all holiday. The recipe for the crust can be used for any pie, so experiment away. There are so many in season and local fruits to be used during the fall season so bake as many apple, pear, and cherry pies as you can. Happy baking!</p>\r\n",

Dried Herbs&mdash;What You Should Know</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many recipes, you can successfully substitute dried herbs for fresh by using a replacement ratio; most often one part dried equals three parts fresh. There are, however, certain times that the dried herbs simply can&rsquo;t stand up to their fresh counterparts from a taste perspective. These include recipes calling for fresh basil, chervil, chives, dill, and parsley. The flavor of the fresh aromatic plant is far superior in these cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Dill%20Dressing%20clear%20dish10_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this recipe for Creamy Dill Dressing, you could swap the dried for the fresh, but truthfully, your results would just not be the same. (Note: if you decide to go rogue and use dried, remember that the dried version is more concentrated. Substitute one teaspoon of dried for one tablespoon of fresh.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, a dressing like this would use yogurt, mayonnaise, or sour cream for richness. I&rsquo;ve swapped the dairy out for cashews, which blend to create a thick, creamy base. The creamy mixture is sweetened&mdash;and thickened just a dab more&mdash;by the dates, while miso adds a welcome saltiness. Throw in a little bit of water, fresh lemon juice, onion, and garlic, and you&rsquo;ve got an easy, memorable dressing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creamy Dill Dressing can also be used as a vegetable dip: keep it thick (leave the water out) and use it to dunk carrots, peppers, radishes, or cucumbers.

We are blessed to have local and in season fruit which fills our pies with delicious flavors and textures and fills the kitchen with magnificent aromas. The great thing about autumn is that we can use the fruit interchangeably in different desserts and pies. When it comes to pie, the key is always the crust. As you take your first bite, you slice through a flakey and rich crust that leaves your stomach smiling. The only downfall with pies, especially commercially baked ones is that they are filled with preservatives, chemicals and a huge amount of sugar and unhealthy fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/Pie%20Crust_IMG_6010_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the commercial pies we buy are loaded with hydrogenated oils and fats due to the need to preserve shelf life. Sadly, these ingredients are what lead to chronic health issues and obesity. After much research both in the kitchen and in the books, I decided to use palm shortening. Unlike its unhealthy counterpart, palm shortening is not hydrogenated. It contains absolutely no trans-fat and has a very high melting point. Making it great for baking, frying, or everyday use. Coconut oil is one of those incredible super foods that has taken the world by storm. It&rsquo;s tropical counterpart, palm oil, seems to have been overshadowed. Palm oil is packed with nutrients, vitamins, and healthy fats to keep you strong and healthy. Just make sure to buy organic or cold pressed as some palm oils are manufactured differently than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just pop into your local health food store, and there will be one waiting on the shelf for you. You can double up the batch of crust and save it in the fridge. It will last up to four days once it&rsquo;s sealed. All you need to do is fill your pie with whatever filling you desire, and you have the perfect gluten-free and vegan pie crust.</p>\r\n",

Healthy and full of fantastic flavor, these pumpkin cinnamon brownies are a hit!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you ever think it was possible to enjoy a decadent, savory brownie that is flour and dairy free? I was taught at a young age that in order to make a delicious brownie, you need tons of added sugar, flour, and butter. Well, I have fantastic news for you: you can make a healthy version of a classic dessert, that in my opinion, tastes even more flavorful than a traditional brownie. Although I don&rsquo;t have celiac disease, I try to stay away from flour as much as possible because it makes foods much heavier than they have to be which can create problems with digestion and inflammation or bloating. During the holiday season when we are surrounded by so many heavy foods, why not make lighter options available that enhance the taste of fan-favorite desserts? These Protein Pumpkin Cinnamon Brownies will make you rethink the way you ever make a brownie again. They are super-fast to make and require very few ingredients, so I like to make these when I need a quick dessert for a party. And you get a boost of extra protein while eating these, so it&rsquo;s a win-win all around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/pumpkin%20brownies%201_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n",

It&rsquo;s easy, fun, and tastes like joy and peace on Earth.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa will be getting a big surprise this year when he sees his Christmas Eve treat has turned pink! As a child, I absolutely loved strawberry milk: sweet, filling and pink. That is what a girl&rsquo;s dreams are made of. As the years progressed and I became vegan, I still craved that strawberry milk. Going back to the grocery store and looking at the nutritional information, I was floored. The amount of sugar and processed ingredients was shocking. I knew I could re-create my own version that would be healthier and taste way better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/bottled%20milk%201_MAIN1.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the base, I used a combination of both almond and cashews. Cashews are one of those super nuts that have so many health benefits. They not only help grow hair, keep bones healthy and strong, but they also help in digestion. Almonds are another super nut, boosting healthy fats, reducing blood sugar levels, and curbing your appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people get nervous about making their own nut milk, but in all honesty, it is very simple. Blend, pour into a milk or cheesecloth, squeeze the liquid out and chill! Simple right? You can create the most delicious nut milks for the holidays using a variety of nuts. One of my favorites is using 2 cups of hazelnuts, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, &frac12; teaspoon nutmeg and 4 pitted Medjool dates. Follow the same directions, and you will have a nutty and spicy nut milk perfect for snow-filled nights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These nut milks will last up to five days in the fridge in a sealed container. This recipe is perfect for the little ones.You can even add a little kick of health to it by including a scoop of <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-berry-500g\" target=\"_blank\">Warrior Blend Berry protein</a>.</p>\r\n",

Holiday Bundt Cake with healthier ingredient choices can be the best of all.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christmas tree is up, carols are playing on the radio, and holiday preparations are in full effect. It is a time where we decide who will be hosting the holidays, what to eat, and where we will be spending time (hopefully with loved ones). For me, the holidays are traditionally about making delicious food and being a scientist creating new desserts. This year, I wanted to blow the dust off my Bundt cake pan. Years ago, I purchased a plethora of mini Bundt pans. I loved the idea that instead of everyone having a slice of cake, they could have their own mini Bundt cake. I used my mini Bundt pans for this recipe, but you can always use the traditional size. Either works!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/bundt_cake_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to add a holiday kick to this recipe. Traditionally, I like to use orange or lemon as my base for the cake, but I opted to use almond and cranberries. The tanginess of the cranberries compliments the nutty flavor of the almond extract. The best thing about these mini Bundt cakes is that they can be devoured for dessert or for a delicious breakfast the following morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used a combination of both almond flour and gluten-free flour blend to give the cake a nutty and crumbly texture. Don&rsquo;t forget to spray or rub your Bundt pan with extra coconut oil to prevent sticking! This recipe is gluten free, dairy free, and celiac safe for everyone! Your holidays have gotten that much healthier and brighter already. You can always experiment with the recipe, adding orange juice, lemon zest, chopped nuts, or even a chocolate drizzle. Make these Bundt cakes your own masterpiece and have a blast in the kitchen.</p>\r\n",

This fancy word is quite incredible but not as obscure as it sounds. Aquafaba is simply the liquid you typically throw away from a can of chickpeas. One of the most incredible things about aquafaba is that it turns out to be the same consistency as a regular mousse, that being very light and fluffy. You will actually see the air pockets inside the mousse when it is set. I have made countless avocado mousses, and although delicious, it&rsquo;s a different texture. Aquafaba can be used to replace egg whites in most vegan baking, so think twice about dumping that chickpea liquid down the sink!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2017/protein%20mousse_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top portion of the mousse was made with agar-agar, which is typically found in powder form and can be used to create vegan gelatin or mousse. The best part about agar-agar is that it&rsquo;s packed with fiber, contains no sugar and no carbohydrates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dessert would be perfect to make for the holiday season. Your guests will be shocked when you tell them how healthy it is (or leave that part out!). You can make a variety of mousses with this recipe such as substituting the berries for chocolate. You can simply melt 1 cup vegan chocolate, let it cool down and then incorporate it into your whipped chickpea water (aquafaba).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding 1 shot of espresso and 2 tablespoons of maple syrup will make this that recipe come to life. You can use a variety of different fruits as well such as in season berries, mangos, coconut, or even peanut butter. This super-rich and silky mouse is decadent but super healthy. It&rsquo;s packed with protein, low carb, dairy-free, and guilt-free.</p>\r\n",

It&rsquo;s packed with protein and is perfect to spread on toast, used as a dip, top on ice cream, or smoothie bowls or of course eaten by the spoonful! It also can be used as a gift! Filling some cute mason jars with homemade cookie butter hummus and tying a bow, would make the perfect present along with some Christmas cookie mix!

After a long day of work, the thought of snacking on guacamole and sipping a freshly-made margarita at my favorite neighborhood restaurant sounds like heaven. But here&rsquo;s the problem: a margarita can have up to 800 calories! They are often loaded with sugar and sodium, causing a rapid and potentially dangerous spike in your blood sugar. Mojitos are another crowd favorite, but I rarely order them because it&rsquo;s like drinking pure sugar. The average mojito has 25 grams of sugar! That&nbsp;much added&nbsp;sugar can lead to weight gain, so why throw away all of your hard work in maintaining a healthy diet and pushing through tough workouts?

This recipe can be stored in the refrigerator and can last up to two months in a sealed container (if it lasts that long!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to purchase a candy thermometer or do not have one, there is a simple trick for knowing that your brittle is finished. Simply put a bowl of ice water near the stove near the boiling syrup. When the syrup begins to turn a golden brown, drop a small amount into the cold water. If the brittle hardens as soon as it hits the water, it&rsquo;s done! I have used this trick many times when I have misplaced my thermometer. If you&rsquo;re heading to any New Year&rsquo;s parties, this is a great treat to bring along!</p>\r\n",

Did you know that carbonated water was invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767 when he discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide after suspending a bowl of water above a beer vat at a brewery in Leeds, England?

I mean, to make tahini, all you do is grind sesame seeds into a butter, the same way you grind peanuts into butter. So yeah. Tahini = sesame seed peanut butter. I like it. Well, I mean, I LOVE tahini. Because it&rsquo;s excellent, both nutritionally and culinarily.

(And a super answer for us plant-eaters who always get asked, &ldquo;So where do you get your calcium?&rdquo;) It&rsquo;s also a phenomenal source of PROTEIN, one of my favorite things in the world. Protein keeps us full, meaning we&rsquo;ll eat less later. I&rsquo;ve also read that the clever combination of calcium, protein, and zinc in tahini also helps hydrate hair and keep it from drying out and thinning &ndash; not a bad bonus feature for this sesame seed peanut butter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But since it&rsquo;s the sesame seed peanut butter, I love to use it in many of the ways that you WOULD use peanut butter but can&rsquo;t if you have a peanut allergy or just want to live life to the fullest, like in smoothies, baked goods, and balls. Protein balls, snack balls, those kinds of balls. I dunno what balls YOU were thinking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here are my vanilla maca tahini snack balls, which includes one of my all-time favorite superfoods, MACA.

Don&rsquo;t be afraid to pick up this brown speckled oversized tuber. Jicama is incredible for your digestion as it has a high amount of fiber. One serving of Jicama can give you 40% of your dietary intake of Vitamin C for the entire day. Jicama is low in calorie and can be eaten cooked or raw. Don&rsquo;t shy away from this vegetable, make it your friend. Jicamas can also be sliced into sticks can be used for dips or bake them into fries!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the salad, we used an assortment of cucumbers, fresh herbs, carrots, asparagus, and tomatoes.

Full of vitamins and flavor, this is the soup to warm you from the inside out!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I crave more than a warm bowl of soup on a frigid day. Split Pea is one of my absolute favorite types of soup, but it&rsquo;s not always easy to find a version that I can eat. The problem is that many places that serve Split Pea soup either put ham in the recipe, cook the soup with ham bones, or use chicken stock as the base. As a non-meat eater, this limits the opportunities I have to enjoy one of my favorite soups. That&rsquo;s why I decided to create a vegan version that is lighter and just as flavorful. Peas are packed with vitamins and have a slew of health benefits, so why not be good to your body while eating something tasty? This recipe is super easy to make and will last all week long, so grab your peas, and let&rsquo;s get cooking!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2018/split%20pea%20soup%20tommy%20didario_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n",

The next time you are at your local grocery store or farmers market, I challenge you to get some collard greens (if they are in season and preferably organic). They are a wonderful green to get into the mix as they are a great source of vitamin C and soluble fiber and contain multiple nutrients with potent anti-cancer properties. Also, the fibrous texture of collards makes them great for saut&eacute;ing and being used as a wrap for burgers and other sandwiches.

The metabolic benefits of eating more fat are so incredible for the body. Helping you stay satiated and full of energy without crashing is one of the best benefits. We, as a society, are bombarded with low-fat and low-calorie products in our supermarkets. The problem is that they are high in carbohydrates and sugar which leads to a major crash in energy only after an hour or two. This can lead to overeating. The best sources of healthy fats come from avocados, olive oil, seeds such as chia or hemp, coconut oil, nuts, and cacao nibs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can play around with this recipe by adding a variety of vegetables such as cauliflower or broccoli.

You&rsquo;re welcome!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I absolutely love the holiday season. It&rsquo;s always a time to get creative in the kitchen and come up with new recipes for loved ones and friends. Why not make something that is sweet but also extremely healthy. What better way to show the ones you love that you love them than with a dessert that&rsquo;s actually good for their health?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2018/avocado%20fat%20bomb_REALMAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the emergence of high-fat diets such as keto and paleo, there has been an influx of &ldquo;fat bombs&rdquo; on the market. Many people are experimenting with ditching the carbohydrates and replacing them with healthy fats such as avocado, nuts, seeds, and healthy oils. The reasoning is that fats keep you satiated longer than carbohydrates. Healthy fats will not make you gain weight, but eating heavily saturated fats such as fried foods and ice cream will. Healthy fats can give you that boost of energy needed to sustain you through the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These avocado fat-bombs are very simple to make. They take all of 20 minutes from start to finish without having to bake them. All you need to do is pop them in the fridge, and you are all set. This recipe is gluten free, low carb, guilt-free, and vegan. These avocado fat-bombs are oh so yummy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to getting the exterior of these avocado fat-bombs are the molds. I bought a half-dome chocolate mold which I found at a bulk food store. They are made of silicone so it&rsquo;s easy to pop the chocolates in and out. These are available in various shapes and sizes so if you don&#39;t love a half dome, you can opt for a square or a heart! Make sure to spray the mold with coconut oil before pouring the first layer of chocolate in, just to ensure it doesn&#39;t stick.</p>\r\n",

We love to sit around and eat our favorite cookies, embrace one another, and appreciate the good times together. In all of that love, we also bake. Shortbread cookies are among one of the top picks for Valentine&rsquo;s day. Creating a cookie that delicious and healthy for us wasn&rsquo;t too challenging.

If you make or buy your own blend, ensure it has guar gum to hold the cookie together. Traditionally, shortbread cookies are made with butter, but we swapped out that culprit for the healthy superstar called coconut oil. Ensure that the coconut oil is room temperature and not melted or your shortbread cookies may not hold up in the oven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We made our own jam for the center of these cookies. The chia jam takes five minutes from start to finish. The best part about this jam is that you control what goes in it. No refined sugars or additives. You can use an abundance of organic fruits. If the berries aren&rsquo;t in season, frozen berries are a perfect alternative. The great thing is that it lasts for up to a week and a half in the fridge in an airtight container. You can play around with the berries you add to your jam. This jam is not only packed with nutrients but also is busting with protein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These cookies will last for up to a week in an airtight container. They are gluten-free, vegan, dairy-free, and guilt free. You will need two different size cookie cutters, a smaller round shape cutter and a larger cutter for the cookie. You can play around with different cookie cutters such as circles, squares, or hearts.</p>\r\n",

This fat-burning recipe is high in antioxidants, fiber, healthy fats, potassium, and protein. These truffles are vegan, gluten-free, tree-nut free, paleo friendly, and low carb, so everyone will be happy! I tried to accommodate as many dietary restrictions as possible while adding multiple superfoods. You can substitute or add any additional toppings you might like. I kept with the anti-inflammatory theme and added extra turmeric, flax seeds, hemp seeds, chia seeds, and cacao nibs. If your diet allows for tree nuts, then chopped nuts of any variety are a great addition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2018/anti%20flammatory%20truffles2_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Turmeric:</em> Turmeric is an anti-inflammatory powerhouse a natural antioxidant due to its high concentration of curcumin. It is widely used for joint health and pain relief. Turmeric can also help settle the stomach and prevent indigestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Avocado:</em> Avocados are high in fiber, healthy fats, and potassium, but low in carbohydrates. Avocados are anti-inflammatory as well, while also helping to regulate blood sugar levels, and assist in nutrient absorption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Flax Seeds:</em> Flax seeds are another ingredient known for their anti-inflammatory properties. They are anti-viral and anti-bacterial. Flax seeds are very high in fiber, potassium, magnesium, and omega 3 fatty acids. These nutrients are what give flax seeds their power to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Chia Seeds:</em> Chia seeds are also anti-inflammatory and help to regulate blood sugar. They have high amounts of fiber, calcium, and healthy fats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hemp Seeds:</em> Hemp seeds offer high amounts of plant protein, phytonutrients, omega 3 fats, and contain 20 amino acids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Raw Cacao:</em> This recipe uses raw cacao powder and nibs. Raw cacao is the highest plant-based source of iron, it has more antioxidants than berries, and it contains one of the highest food-based sources of magnesium. Cacao is known to support heart health, balance blood sugar, and regulate mood. In addition to magnesium, cacao also contains chromium, iron, manganese, phosphorus, zinc, and copper. See &ndash; chocolate isn&rsquo;t bad for you! (when it&rsquo;s the right kind, that is.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Coconut:</em> In this recipe, both coconut oil and coconut butter are used. Coconut contains high amounts of antioxidants and healthy fats that help lower cholesterol and boost metabolism. Coconut has antibacterial properties, and it is also low in sugar and high in fiber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Maca: </em>Maca root is very powerful due to high amounts of amino acids, vitamins, and enzymes. Maca helps regulate hormones, increase energy and reduce anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sunwarrior Protein: </em>I used the <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-chocolate-500g\">Chocolate Sunwarrior Warrior Blend protein</a> in this recipe. This is a raw, plant-based protein with BCAA&rsquo;s, Arginine, Lysine, and Leucine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

An additional option with this recipe is to either put the mixture into a mold or tin before placing in the refrigerator to make it into fudge. If you turn it into a fudge instead of balls or truffles, then add any toppings or dusting powders you would like into the mixture beforehand. Place in refrigerator for 1 hour, then cut, and either eat immediately or refrigerate for up to one week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

February marks Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and it&rsquo;s a reason to celebrate our loved ones. Although, most of us have tried to keep with New Year&rsquo;s resolutions of eating healthy and making our new year filled with accomplishments of health and wellbeing. Valentines does not need to be an excuse to break any of these promises made to ourselves. These cupcakes are made with beets and chocolate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2018/cupcakes_valentines_red%20velvet_shutterstock_364829120_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using beets in this recipe will give the cupcakes that beautiful and glowing red color. Instead of using highly processed food colorings, we used the natural beauty and color of the beets to shine through. Even if you are not a fan of beets, you can barely notice the flavor. Adding beets to this recipe will boost the nutritional value of the cupcake and give you all of the incredible benefits such as vitamin c, fiber, and potassium. Beets are incredible for helping to boost athletic performance and can help reduce inflammation in the body. Beets can even help our brain function, making our cognitive abilities that much sharper. To make these cupcakes even more nutrient dense, we added a scoop of <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-natural-500g\">Sunwarrior protein</a> to give them a boost of plant-based protein. Can this recipe get any sweeter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The icing is very simple to make. Ensure that the coconut milk is chilled for a minimum of 24 hours in the fridge.&nbsp; This icing is 100 percent natural and contains no additives or copious amounts of sugar. Coconut milk boosts so many incredible health benefits just like beets. Coconut milk can help provide electrolytes to the body, provide healthy fats for the body and can even improve digestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only is this cupcake delicious, but it&rsquo;s also packed with nutrients, enzymes, and minerals to fuel us during the day. Now that&rsquo;s what I call a sweet valentines!&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

They are high in Vitamin C and are powerful antioxidants. Lemon juice can increase iron absorption, boost the immune system, and even help you maintain a healthy complexion. That&rsquo;s why lemon poppy seed muffins came to mind. I don&#39;t really think about lemon poppy seed-flavored anything, mainly because lemon desserts tend to taste a little too strong and tart. If not tart, they are too buttery, heavy, or dry. So, I wrote lemon poppy seed muffins off as being unimpressive. But this changed when I decided to make a vegan, gluten-free, no sugar added version. When done right, lemon can add a refreshing flavor that is perfect for any time of year, but especially when you might be missing summer. So, try this light recipe and enjoy the new and improved version of lemon poppy seed muffins!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2018/lemon%20poppyseed1_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n",

Banana bread is one of those treats that is amazing, but sadly it is filled with processed and refined sugars, butter, preservatives, and flours. Although bananas are an incredible way to start the morning, opting for that slice of banana bread at your local cafe is not the greatest start. It will leave you feeling lethargic and heavy. You may feel as though you&rsquo;re crashing an hour or two after consuming it because your body is working double time to digest it. Now, how about we replace that with a more nutrient-dense cake? This raw vegan version will keep you energized and satiated! This banana loaf is gluten free, grain free, dairy free and one hundred percent raw vegan. It&rsquo;s also delicious, naturally sweetened, and will come together in less than ten minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2018/banana%20Bread_shutterstock_537709471_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe uses whole foods. We use an abundance of fruit and vegetables along with nuts, dates and flax meal. Flax meal is super high in fiber and low in carbohydrates. Flax is high in both insoluble and soluble fiber. This can help reduce sugar cravings, increase fat loss, and keep you satiated longer. Flax seeds are also high in Omega-3 fatty acids which is crucial for a healthy diet. We also used a blend of both brazil nuts and walnuts: both with incredible health properties. These both increase brain health, helping to improve cognitive abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used a dehydrator in this recipe, but you can always place it in the oven at the lowest temperature for 6 hours. This banana loaf can be enjoyed anytime during the day, morning to night! Try not to eat all of the dough out of the bowl before baking it. Top this banana bread with nut butter or jam to add an extra dose of deliciousness.</p>\r\n",

The most fun with this granola is how it bakes up into bite-size pieces, making it a perfect snack when you are on the run, and there&rsquo;s no time to sit down for a bowl of cereal or a parfait. The recipe makes about 3 cups and is easily doubled. I highly suggest doing so if you have a household of more than two.

Whether we&rsquo;re jacked or not, all of us can experience the fun of drinking a JACKED UP GOLDEN SMOOTHIE which helps those big strong muscles of yours recover from a workout so you can go back to life and win in motherhood or fatherhood or employeehood or take first place in a This is Us Marathon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2018/turmeric_shutterstock_210630367_Smoothie_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The turmeric in this smoothie has some great anti-inflammatory properties which can really help soothe our swollen, achy joints and muscles. One of the active components in Turmeric and the stuff that makes turmeric yellow (which looks great in this smoothie but not on your stained t-shirt) are called curcumins. Curcumin provides awesome antioxidants which can help keep your immune system strong after you kick your own booty in the gym, AND it could even help ease that post-workout pain!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plant-protein, a la Sunwarrior, helps your body rebuild the muscles it broke down when it worked out. Duh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The maca is terrific at giving your adrenals some TLC. Your adrenals, by the way, work their butts off to release hormones that help you perform your butt off during a workout. But under the stress of hard exercise and after you drink caffeine before your hard exercise, they get a little burnt out, and maca is a superstar at helping them recover. And the ginger is that deliciousness that helps with muscle soreness. Many studies have been done and concluded that consuming ginger post-workout can speed up your recovery time and give you fewer excuses to miss tomorrow&rsquo;s workout! Sorry, I&rsquo;m not sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you will be sorry if you don&rsquo;t try this smoothie.</p>\r\n",

Especially inspect the bottom, and pick one without mold or cracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turn the coconut on its side and begin slicing off the husk from the pointed part of the coconut. Use a sharp knife with a 90-degree corner edge and slice until you see the nut crowning (it&rsquo;ll be browner than the husk)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stand your coconut right side up and chop&mdash;swiftly and firmly&mdash;into the base of one of the spines (the edge of the nut you just revealed) using the bottom corner edge of the knife.

Although delicious, the traditional pecan pie is loaded with copious amounts of sugar, fat, and wheat. The combination of the three will make your blood sugar spike and send your brain into a fog. Indulging in desserts does not have to be unhealthy. We created a protein-packed pecan square that is equally as delicious as the conventional pecan pie. We used almond flour which contains iron, minerals, and protein. The best part about almond flour is that it contains one ingredient; almonds! White flour on the contrast has very little nutrients. The good qualities of the wheat normally has been stripped away. White flour can lead to fatigue, anxiety, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best thing about this recipe is that it is creamy, rich and guilt free. Pecans are wonderful sources of protein and calcium and are incredible for your hair and skin. This recipe uses whole food ingredients to ensure you are receiving the best mixture of ingredients.

Chia pudding is a great breakfast or pick-me-up snack as it is rich in antioxidants, omega 3 fatty acids, and can help to provide loads of fiber, iron, and calcium &ndash; nutrients which are often overlooked in plant-based diets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this recipe, we&rsquo;re using Matcha! I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen the matcha craze over the past couple of years, and there&rsquo;s good reason! Not only does matcha help to detoxify the body, but it also may help to reduce the risk of cancer, and can even help promote weight loss. If you&rsquo;re a big coffee drinker or an &ldquo;anything but water&rdquo; drinker, matcha can be a great substitute as it not only tastes delicious but can aid your body in so many ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While you can use whatever plant milk you&rsquo;d like in chia pudding, this version contains coconut milk! Not only is it a great texture and flavor, but I love the dose of healthy fats I get from coconut milk. When paired with the matcha, you get an extremely creamy texture that&rsquo;s almost like a matcha latte but just thicker&hellip;and with chia seeds!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite thing to do is to make a huge batch of this chia pudding and pre-portion it into jars for grab-and-go options. You can also make this super customizable by adding a scoop of <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-vanilla-500g\">Sunwarior Warrior Blend vanilla protein</a>, mini chocolate chips, hemp seeds, or a variety of nuts and fruits.</p>\r\n",

Although delicious, the traditional pecan pie is loaded with copious amounts of sugar, fat, and wheat. The combination of the three will make your blood sugar spike and send your brain into a fog. Indulging in desserts does not have to be unhealthy. We created a protein-packed pecan square that is equally as delicious as the conventional pecan pie. We used almond flour which contains iron, minerals, and protein. The best part about almond flour is that it contains one ingredient; almonds! White flour on the contrast has very little nutrients. The good qualities of the wheat normally has been stripped away. White flour can lead to fatigue, anxiety, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best thing about this recipe is that it is creamy, rich and guilt free. Pecans are wonderful sources of protein and calcium and are incredible for your hair and skin. This recipe uses whole food ingredients to ensure you are receiving the best mixture of ingredients. You could easily make this recipe into a pie if you didn&rsquo;t want squares. Whichever way you eat it, your stomach will be dancing with joy.</p>\r\n",

More and more people today are talking about gut health (we see this with the rise of probiotic and kombuchas), so it&rsquo;s also worth noting that these types of potatoes are packed with fiber and assist in maintaining a healthy digestive system. They help fight off chronic disease and have many anti-aging properties. The bottom line? You should be eating sweet potatoes!

So I dug deep and pulled out a classic recipe, scalloped potatoes. These potatoes can be served up with any main dish or can be used as a main dish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are very simple to make, and you only need the basic ingredients. You can give them a boast and add vegan ham and cheese to make them a main dish, but you can also leave them with not much more than the sauce to add to an already full meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potatoes are very low in calorie with no fat, sodium, or cholesterol. They have more potassium than a banana and also have vitamin B6, fiber, and antioxidants. Almond milk is also low in calories and high in vitamin D. They are a good pair that make a killer dish.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

But what I thought to be a healthy snack turned out to be a snack that was sky high in sodium. When I learned how to read food labels and the reality hit in that my go-to healthy snack wasn&rsquo;t so healthy, I wanted to create one that was. Over the years I have been searching for a healthy pretzel. Time and time again, I&rsquo;ve been disappointed. With the emergence of healthy eating and gluten-free sensitive&rsquo;s, companies have been creating gluten-free and sodium free pretzels. When I first discovered them, I did a happy dance and devoured the entire package. I couldn&rsquo;t have been more elated with this product. One night, I was experimenting in the kitchen with recipes, and one of the pretzels fell into my coconut butter mixture I was creating for a cupcake, I took the pretzel out and left it on a plate, meaning to throw it out later. When I was cleaning up, I saw that the mixture had solidified and voila, a new invention was created (the best ones are always by accident right?). Toiling around with the recipe I created a white &ldquo;chocolate&rdquo; protein pretzel. Now my life was really complete!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best part of this recipe is that it uses coconut butter. Coconut butter is one of those miracle foods that has so many incredible health benefits such as helping to boost immunity and ward off viruses because of its antibacterial properties. Coconut butter also helps to burn fat in the body and is the perfect fuel to get the body going. Make sure when you are purchasing this product that it says coconut butter on the label. Coconut oil and butter are two different things so opt for the latter. Paired with <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-vanilla-500g\">Sunwarrior protein</a>, you have yourself a delicious vegan, protein-packed, gluten-free snack.

Always preparing coffee cakes for our parties and events in the family. I remember being in the kitchen with her and watching her bake this marvelous creation that we all have grown up on. Recreating a coffee cake as good as hers is nearly impossible because it came from her hands but recreating a recipe that pays homage to this cake was a mission I was ready to embark on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coffee cake sounds simple to make right? I thought I would nail it on the first try. Not quite! Recreating a coffee cake that was vegan and tasted up to standards definitely took me a few tries. I wanted to also make it gluten-free, so most of my attempts came out too mushy or dry like a sponge. Luckily, I landed on a recipe that I could publish and was delicious. Experimenting with different nut milks and sugars, I recommend using higher fat nut milk like coconut milk. This will give your cupcakes more moisture and will be more flavorful. Don&rsquo;t be frightened by using full-fat coconut milk. The fat in coconut milk will actually help you to lose weight or get rid of excess fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe calls for oat flour, which is a great substitute for gluten-free baking. Using coconut sugar and applesauce created the sweetness this cake needed. Luckily, this will not spike your blood sugar levels because they both are lower glycemic sweeteners. Applesauce is a great substitute to use in vegan baking as it acts like an egg. This will bind the recipe together. You can also add in some fruits such as apples or even blueberries to make this recipe your own. This recipe is a great base for many experiments in the kitchen.</p>\r\n",

Cacao is the HEALTHY form of chocolate. It grows on trees in football-like colorful pods. When you open a cacao pod, you&rsquo;ll find huge seeds inside that are called cacao beans even though they&rsquo;re seeds (weird but just go with it). If you dry the beans, remove their skin and press on them a bit, they crumble naturally into&hellip;.NIBS!! (Gotta love cacao nibs.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But ferment the nibs, grind them up, extract the fat (aka cacao butter) and you&rsquo;ll get yourself some decadent cacao powder!

Cocoa is heated and also has sugar and other crap added to it, cacao is unadulterated awesome.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K, so clearly, consuming chocolate by way of cacao is how you can justify calling chocolate &ldquo;healthy.&rdquo; And this truly amazing, easy to make, high in plant-protein, quinoa-based CACAO GRANOLA is how you can justify eating chocolate for breakfast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMwdXBJiVF0\" width=\"760\"></iframe></p>\r\n",

The only issue is that sometimes all the toppings and sweeteners can deteriorate the nutritional value that oatmeal has to offer. Oatmeal is high in fiber, iron, protein, magnesium, and many other vitamins and minerals. These nutrients provided by oats can help lower cholesterol, stabilize blood sugar, and promote weight loss. Many commercialized oat brands add sugar or other sweeteners to prepackaged servings. For this recipe, I recommend using gluten-free oats that are rolled oats or steel cut oats, and even instant oats are fine as long as there is only one ingredient on the label.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flax seeds are high in omega-3 fatty acids and fiber. Chia seeds are also a great source of omega-3s, as well as calcium. Hemp seeds are a complete protein and contain both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids. Maca root helps to balance hormones and increases energy. Getting sweetness from cinnamon, vanilla extract, and protein powder that is only sweetened with stevia leaf ensures bursting flavor without added sugar spikes and unnecessary carbohydrates. To top it off, not only are blueberries in season for spring, but they are very high in antioxidants and flavor, and low in sugar.</p>\r\n",

All you have to do is place everything in a food processor and then blend until smooth. Garlic hummus? No problem. Lemon hummus? Easy peasy! Greek hummus? Just add some Kalamata olives and oregano! In this case, however, we&rsquo;re talking about harissa hummus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t been introduced to harissa yet, then allow me to be the first! A combination of roasted red peppers, vinegar, and sugar come together to make this delicious condiment that can be added to almost anything. The spice levels range depending on which one you buy, but I prefer the mild flavor as you can always make it spicier with red chili flakes. Harissa can be found at your local grocery store &ndash; most of the time &ndash; just make sure to ask if you don&rsquo;t see it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe is so versatile, and it comes together in five minutes flat! Whether you need a quick appetizer for guests or are just looking for something to dip your carrots in, this recipe is for you. Personally, I like to make a double batch and then have it in the fridge for the whole week (yes, we do eat that much hummus). I put it on toast, salads, and dip all sorts of veggies in it. It&rsquo;s a great, oil-free, healthy alternative to fattening dressings and spreads that can add unwanted calories to your meals!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: you can also use dried chickpeas and then cook them to soften them. Soak &frac12; cup dried chickpeas for 8 hours. Drain and rinse, then boil the chickpeas for about 45 minutes or until tender. If you like your hummus warm, make the hummus right after you finish boiling the chickpeas.</p>\r\n",

My friends always complained that they were hungry an hour after eating their salads, therefore always snacking on foods until dinner time. By adding more hearty and nutrient dense vegetables, this salad will leave you satiated! This salad is great if you double it and refrigerate it for the following day. This recipe is popping with flavors; it is hard to resist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This salad not only is bustling with greens and vegetables, but it also adds the incredible power of red rice. Red rice is unhulled like it&rsquo;s counterpart brown rice adding more nutritional value to the grain. Red rice is very high in bran; therefore, the fiber content is high. This will help regulate your digestive system. The flavor of red rice is beautiful nutty flavor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spring is the time that greens are blooming and ready to eat. Take a day on the weekend to visit your local farmers market to see which greens are in season and local. I found delicious kale and collard greens for this salad, but any green will work. When your greens are local and have been harvested only a few days prior is when the maximum amount of nutrients are present. The salad dressing comes together in no time. We use orange juice to give it a touch of sweetness, but you can always omit it for lemon or lime juice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

I quickly discovered that many of my favorite wok fried dishes were inherently plant-based, besides of course the meat, fish, and egg ingredients. To my amazement, simply removing these items and substituting tofu or extra veggies led to many simple and satisfying vegan meals. I credit this experience with laying the foundation for my path, teaching me that living a plant-based lifestyle is not as hard as it sounds. In fact, it&rsquo;s a breeze!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turns out, a lot of Asian cuisines are easy to recreate at home, especially those of the wok fried variety. After much experimentation, I have crafted a simple recipe for delicious fried rice with a Thai inspired peanut butter sauce. I&rsquo;ve decided to nickname it &ldquo;The Crowd Pleaser,&rdquo; due to the overwhelmingly positive feedback upon sharing with several co-workers during a lunch break. The Crowd Pleaser is a hearty, healthy and versatile entr&eacute;e, so feel free to serve it as the main course, or as an awesome side dish to other foods. Either way it is tried, tested, and guaranteed to make everyone happy&mdash;even the omnivores!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sincerely hope you enjoy this recipe. In closing: you are what you eat, and food always tastes better off someone else&rsquo;s plate, so eat light, and always make enough to share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeds 4-6 people</p>\r\n",

Odd or not, once you bite into one slice of this delightful cake, your taste buds will be doing a happy dance. These two ingredients are thyme and lemon. Yes, at first it sounds savory, a little odd, and something you would throw together in a kitchen sink type of recipe. I promise; this tastes incredible. If you aren&rsquo;t a fan of thyme, you could always replace it with rosemary or lavender. The possibilities are endless. This cake can be made for spring brunches, birthday parties, or even that daily desert we all crave in the morning or after dinner. Using a different variety of flavors and herbs to our desserts can enhance the core flavor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This recipe is a spring favorite but can be used during fall as well as the flavors intermix with the seasons. This isn&rsquo;t your typical loaf cake which can be super dry. This cake is moist, bursting with fresh flavors, and spongey. Adding a lemon syrup to the cake while it&rsquo;s cooling gives that extra burst of freshness. The beautiful thing about this cake is that it&#39;s gluten-free and of course, vegan. This cake resembles something you would buy at your local coffee shop. Speckled with perfection and too pretty to eat, until you take that first bite. To ensure freshness, you can always pop this into the fridge when it&rsquo;s cooled, and it lasts a few days longer than if it was sitting out (if it lasts that long!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a foolproof recipe that will come together in no time. You can double up the batch and pop it into the fridge for five days if you plan on making a second loaf during that time.</p>\r\n",

I grew up on macaroni salad, but I had to find a way to make it taste just as delicious as I remembered while still keeping it vegan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few trial and error attempts, I landed on a recipe that my friends loved. They had no idea that it was vegan and they were perplexed on how similar it tasted. Brownie points on that one! I love this recipe because it comes together so quickly. You can make a huge batch, pop it in the fridge, and take it with you the next day. The best part is that it keeps for a long time in the fridge. I opted to use regular elbow pasta for this recipe, but if you are sensitive to gluten, you can always swap it out for gluten-free pasta. It will taste just as delicious. I kept my macaroni salad more basic for this recipe so if you wanted to experiment with different vegetables or herbs. Some examples would be adding fresh dill instead of parsley, adding fresh cucumbers, carrots, and red onion. Whichever vegetables you have an affinity for, add them in. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; type of recipe so have fun with it and enjoy!</p>\r\n",

That&rsquo;s why I came up with this warming bevvie, a tonic, if you will, that tastes like a naughty dessert but is anything but.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, is also has lots of de-bloating powers so one could actually possibly justify that this is a magical, health-boosting, must-drink nightcap!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s got an all-star line-up of de-bloaters: ginger, a very famous stomach-soother, cinnamon, vanilla, which help with relaxation (a lovely antidote to bloating), and dates, a magnesium-rich plant that can help stimulate bowel movements and make that bloating begone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply blend the following ingredients and then warm them in a saucepan on your stove for a guilt-free, gut-nourishing nightcap.</p>\r\n",

One of them is that even desserts are healthy! As parents or workaholics or fitness freaks, we all have one thing in common. We want to feed ourselves and our family healthy foods. The superfood popsicle is one of my favorite recipes. It satisfies your sweet tooth, it&rsquo;s healthy, and you&rsquo;re eating ice cream that isn&rsquo;t creating a cavity or other health issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Health Benefits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coconut milk contains healthy fat and medium-chain fatty acids which don&#39;t get consumed by our body in the same way as high saturated fats. It&rsquo;s also rich in anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties, and it nourishes your joints and muscles inside out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spirulina</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirulina contains a high amount of protein and antioxidants. A small amount of Spirulina can fight free radicals, reduce muscle soreness, improve bone density, and help detoxify</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Moringa Powder</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moringa is rich in flavonoids and phytonutrients that fight free radicals, increase DNA oxidization and protect the body from infections and tumors. Being rich in Vitamin A, C, and K, this is a perfect ingredient to consume on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t have Moringa or Spirulina?&nbsp;&nbsp;Get our <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/ormus-supergreens-natural-8oz\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;\">Super Greens here!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Coconut Nectar</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raw coconut nectar naturally has a low GI and is packed with essential vitamins and minerals. It&rsquo;s also high in prebiotic fiber that aids digestion and reduces bloating and gas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Banana</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fruit is well known for its high potassium and magnesium content. It&rsquo;s also rich in Vitamin C and K making it the perfect ingredient for a pre or post-workout snack. This is also a great way to add more fruits to your diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat right.

In fact, several clinical studies show that soy doesn&rsquo;t affect testosterone levels or cause feminizing effects in men. Instead, soy protein enhances the growth of lean tissue while stimulating weight loss. It&rsquo;s packed with amino acids, iron, calcium, and zinc. There is so much to discuss regarding this topic, but the main takeaway is that tofu is a delicious, nutritious, and impactful food to eat on a plant-based diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have seen the rise of air fryer photos going around social media. The benefits of cooking with them are amazing! They encourage low-fat meals, simple and clean ingredients, and using air to evenly cook your food. You can&rsquo;t get healthier than that! This is a recipe that I cook several times throughout the week. It&rsquo;s super healthy and packed with flavor. The best part? It makes for a quick meal (and even quicker clean-up)! Pair it with some quinoa and a big side salad with veggies, and you are good to go! Grab some non-GMO tofu, and let&rsquo; get cooking!</p>\r\n",

It&rsquo;s where amazing and delicious party!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2018/espresso%20shake%201_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the summer is rolling by, we crave drinks that are icy, cold, and refreshing. I am a big lover of all things coffee, so iced coffee is always my go-to drink. Some are simply coffee and nut milks, or some are blended. Here in Toronto, the mornings are not warm so having that morning cup of brew that is warm does that trick. Halfway through the day is another story completely. I always crave rich and cold drinks, but I know how bad they are for us nutritionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went home one day and said to myself; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to make this taste as good as the coffee shop, only healthier.&rdquo; After one try, I landed on an amazing recipe that I use daily. The best part about this recipe is that it is guilt free and nutritionally fantastic for our bodies. So what&rsquo;s in this magical shake?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recipe is so simple. All you need to do is pop the ingredients into your blender, and one minute later you have a silky and scrumptious protein shake. I add a frozen banana, almond milk, <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-vanilla-500g\">Sunwarrior protein powder</a>, 1 shot of espresso, and a tablespoon of maca. Maca is derived from a root vegetable. It is rich in antioxidants and helps to enhance our mood and energy. Maca totally beats out anything caffeine can do. I found that after an hour, my caffeine kick would die out and I was left tired and restless. I added the maca powder, and it helped me sustain a great amount of energy during the day without the burn and crash from too much coffee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to play around with the recipe, you can add some chocolate chips or cocoa powder to make this a mocha iced coffee. You can even add some fresh mint or mint extract to make this a mint coffee drink. Whatever you add, the end result will always end up being delicious.</p>\r\n",

Let us show you how to make vegan tahini brownies right!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/health_hub/article/2018/Brownies_tahini_Rachel%20Sklar_IMG_0540_MAIN.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people are cake type brownie lovers, but personally, I love dense ones. But brownies are typically made with an abundance of unhealthy ingredients such as flour, refined sugar, and oil. So I came up with a recipe that is healthier and even tastier! The eggs are substituted with flax eggs. Whenever I give my friends these brownies to eat, they are shocked that they are vegan and actually taste delicious. Without failure, this recipe is always requested, which means I make triple batches for everyone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started to incorporate tahini into my everyday cooking. I became addicted to this stuff after purchasing a tahini nut butter. I tested it out in baking and cooking and found that it was a great substitute in salad dressings or in cakes. Tahini has a rich and velvety texture that adds so much flavor to any dish you are eating, plus it adds an endless amount of nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tahini is one of those amazing superfoods that boosts health benefits such as being high in healthy fats and amino acids. It also has a high amount of vitamins and minerals that our bodies need for great metabolic and bone health. Tahini is made of sesame seeds which are great to balance hormonal levels in our bodies. Plus tahini can help us look radiant and fresh due to its skin health. All of this from one brownie, I&rsquo;m in!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This brownie wouldn&#39;t be complete without adding some <a href=\"http://www.sunwarrior.com/store/warrior-blend-chocolate-500g.html\">Sunwarrior protein powder</a> to help our muscles regenerate and give us the extra bit of nutrients we may be lacking during a day. I added <a href=\"http://www.sunwarrior.com/store/warrior-blend-chocolate-500g.html\">Sunwarrior chocolate protein</a>, but you can always opt to use the <a href=\"https://sunwarrior.com/store/product/warrior-blend-natural-500g\">natural flavor</a> one as well since the natural ends up being neutral. Second helpings for this brownie? Yes please, sign me up for three helpings!</p>\r\n",

For an upcoming holiday dinner, my son asked if I could find a way to make rolls for dinner. I was at a loss. There are so many ways to make gluten-free rolls. I scoured the internet, and most of the recipes call for a homemade gluten-free flour or a kind of flour that I had no access to. I didn&rsquo;t want to buy a lot of different flours when I had no use for them really. After speaking with some people that are gluten free and reading many reviews on store-bought gluten-free flours, I settled for Bob&rsquo;s Red Mill gluten-free flour. The rolls turned out fantastic, and my son&rsquo;s friend was forever grateful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all gluten-free flours are made equal. Some are more for breads, and some are more for cookies. If you find a flour you want to try, I would either talk to someone that is gluten free and knows their flours or read what the flour is best used for. The shape of your pan is very important. The dough is not like the dough for normal gluten rolls. They are very sticky. Choose a pan that will help the rolls stay upright. I used a pie pan that was perfect for these rolls. Also, you will not get the same results if you measure the flour with a cup. It is very important to use a scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am by no means an expert. I&rsquo;ve made this recipe and found it delicious even for those that aren&rsquo;t gluten-free. If you need to become gluten free, this is a great way to start.</p>\r\n",

You are so gorgeous to our view! What&rsquo;s blue, colorful and looks like something designed by the blue fairy? It&rsquo;s the newest craze called Blue Majik.. After seeing many people in the city consuming this gorgeous turquoise smoothie, a recipe had to be created. Many of those colorful lattes or drinks we see people consuming are actually added food coloring which I am not a fan of. Food coloring contains chemicals and additives that serve no purpose to the body. The key to this bright smoothie is limiting the number of ingredients that go into it. For best results, only add ingredients that are neutral in color or white such as almond milk, protein powder, banana, or vegan yogurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This powder is derived from spirulina. This powder has high concentrations of proteins, vitamins, and nutrients.&nbsp; We added this superfood to our smoothie bowl, and it was absolutely delicious. This newest food trend seems to be popping up in juices, lattes, and smoothies. The best quality about Blue Majik is that it contains B12. Vegans often suffer from low vitamin B12 because it is not readily found in a lot of foods. Although this powder does have a powerful smell, we promise it tastes incredible mixed into smoothies. Since you only need such a small amount of the powder, it will last you a long time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best thing about this smoothie is that it&rsquo;s fantastic first thing in the morning. Unlike cereals, cookies, or cakes, this smoothie bowl won&rsquo;t give you a crash half way through the day. Plus, it&rsquo;s super simple; toss everything in the blender and voila! Top with any fruit, granola, nuts, seeds, or coconut whip. Make this bowl your masterpiece and enjoy every last blue sip.</p>\r\n",

I have recently discovered jackfruit! Jackfruit is an amazing meaty fruit that has a neutral taste. Whatever you flavor it, it takes on that taste. I discovered it one day when eating at a health-conscious Latin American restaurant. I asked if they had a vegan &ldquo;meat&rdquo; option and the server said &ldquo;We have jackfruit. It is soy-free and gluten-free with a meat-like texture.&rdquo; I was intrigued. So I ordered my salad with barbequed jackfruit on top. To my surprise, it was quite delicious! I actually liked it better than my other faux meats because it was not processed. I loved it so much, I have created my own recipe, and now I make it at pretty regularly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of</strong> <strong>Jackfruit:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackfruit is rich in vitamins, minerals and lots of dietary fiber, which makes it a good natural laxative. It is also a viable source of minerals, such as iron, magnesium, potassium, and manganese as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fun Facts about Zucchini:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that jackfruit is the largest fruit that grows on trees? It can grow up to 100 lbs! It is widely cultivated in throughout tropical regions in the world. It is the national fruit of Bangladesh.</p>\r\n",

They are not only enjoyed in Canada but everywhere around the world, and there are good reasons for it! Super sweet and addictive, you will probably go for seconds and perhaps even thirds. This recipe swapped out many of the unhealthy and refined ingredients that go into these bars for more nutritious and health-conscious ingredients. Using only the best such as coconut oil, cashews, and dates, these bad boys are packed with essential nutrients, proteins, and minerals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never had a Nanaimo bar, the explanation would be such. Chewy chocolate base with a delectable creme filling. Typically slathered with some kind of chocolate coating or ganache. They are definitely a treat and can be quiet overtly sweet. This recipe uses dates, a vegan&rsquo;s best friend. Not only are dates a natural form of sugar they also contain fiber which fills you up and helps with digestive problems. Hold up, a cookie bar that&rsquo;s actually good for you? Shocking! These bars are ten times better than any store bought Nanaimo bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These bars are great any time of day, and since they contain all natural ingredients, they are guilt free (even at 4am).This recipe is gluten-free, grain-free, vegan, and 100 percent worthy of that second serving. They also freeze well. You can double the recipe, cut them into squares, pop them into a freezer safe container and voila! Dessert any time of year. If you wanted to spice up the recipe, you could add mint to the creme filling to create a mint chocolate Nanaimo bar which I make for the holidays. This is my homage to the Canadian classic, happy baking!</p>\r\n",
